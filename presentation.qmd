## Let us consider two explanations {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

## Let us consider two explanations {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

Mental illness happen as results from the dynamic interplay of **biological** (genetics, neurobiology), **psychological** (personality, coping styles), and **social risks** (relationships, trauma, socioeconomic status). **Medication** and **psychotherapy** can help restore this balance.

. . .

[Mental illness are **tests from God** that can make us stronger spiritually. One can find the peace through **prayer**, **remembering God**, and **trusting** that difficulties have purpose.]{.alert}

. . . 

Which one do you personally think more [**convincing**]{.alert} or [**most useful**]{.alert}?

. . .

Some people may be convinced that it's [**one explanation against another**]{.alert}, but for others, the answer can be less straightforward.

## Desideratum {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

:::{.callout-warning}

This presentation, however, won't dig deeper into whether or not these two types of explanations [**logically or illogically compatible**]{.alert}, its [**truthfulness**]{.alert} quality, or [**accuracy**]{.alert}.

:::

. . .

Rather, and more interestingly, what does it mean to [**believe**]{.alert} in science and religion, **psychologically**?

Do you still remember how do you [**first learn**]{.alert} that God and oxygen, while both are invisible, exist?

::: {.notes}
Think about when you did that experiment back in the primary school, where you lighted up a candle and your teacher asked you to deplete the oxygen by covering the candle entirely with a glass. The now dead candle basically shows you that oxygen exists.

Though, we learn about God, Angels, and the afterlife, by going through a bit of different process - we heard stories from our parents, grandparents, your Ustadz and Ustadzah in Taman Pendidikan Al Qur'an and so on and so forth.
:::

## How do people acquire scientific and religious explanations? {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

- Plenty of evidence demonstrates that we naive theories about unobservable entities (e.g., God, bacteria, Angels, mental processes, etc.) primarily through **testimony** [@maScientificReligiousBeliefs2024].

- This means we learn these explanations by combining **direct experience** [@mcloughlinExpressionsUncertaintyInvisible2023] and **cultural input** [@davoodiWhenCulturalInput2022].
  - **Direct experience**: first-hand, observational experience that is independent of others' testimony.
  - **Cultural input**: information we obtain from other individuals of our group and community, both verbally or symbolically.
  
- Testimony **don't matter** if we don't trust the sources, so **trust** here is essential for belief acquisition [@hendriksTrustScienceScience2016].

## How do people acquire scientific and religious explanations? {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

When acquiring scientific explanations, cultural input is much less central, rendering individuals **more confident** with their **scientific** than [**religious**]{.alert} beliefs [@harrisBeliefsChildrenAdults2021].

## Shared Psychological Functions {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

::::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

Not only people develop their scientific and religious understanding in the same manner, science and religion also satisfy [**similar psychological needs**]{.alert} [@rutjensChapter26Science2020]. Specifically, they fulfill:

- **Need for explanation**: to understand why events occur and how things work, seeking causal accounts that make sense of experiences and observations
- **Need for control**: to influence outcomes and have agency over one's environment

Not only people develop their scientific and religious understanding in the same manner, science and religion also satisfy [**similar psychological needs**]{.alert} [@rutjensChapter26Science2020]. Specifically, they fulfill:

- **Need for existential meaning**: to find purpose, significance, and coherence in existence

:::

. . .

If scientific and religious belief are acquired similarly and fulfill the exact same needs, does it mean they are [*psychologically* **competing**]{.alert} for our mental resource?

## Secularization and Conceptual Change {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

It's, of course, **natural to assume** that religious and scientific explanations are competing for our mental resource. 

. . .

Literature proposes that the competition occurs not only at **individual**, but also at **institutional** level.

. . . 

- **Secularization hypothesis**: scholars (e.g., Freud, Durkheim) have long predicted that religion would lose its relevance with the rapid emergence of industrialization [@inglehartWhyDidntReligion2007].
- **Conceptual change hypothesis**: as children start to learn science, their naive theories, including religious beliefs, are accommodated (in Piagetian term), or completely replaced by scientific beliefs [@posnerAccomodationScientificConception1982].

::: {.notes}

:::

## Secularization and Conceptual Change {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

:::{.callout-warning}

If these two hypotheses are correct, then we should observe that [**religious institutions cease to exist**]{.alert} in the face of scientific progress and individuals [**completely abandon their religious beliefs**]{.alert} when they receive scientific training.

:::

. . .

We do observe these patterns, at least partially.

- There is a **declining** trend of engagement in religious activities - more strongly in industrialized secular countries [@inglehartWhyDidntReligion2007].
- Evidence shows that people tend to **ascribe incompatibility** between science and religion when they are entering higher education [@scheitleEndorsementReligionScience2021; @shipmanChangesStudentViews2002].
- Plenty large-scale research demonstrates that **reflective and critical thinking**, cognitive process fundamental in fostering scientific beliefs, are **correlated with God disbelief** [@ghasemiReflectiveThinkingPredicts2025].

::: {.notes}
Which means that reflective and critical thinkers are less likely to be religious

## Secularization and Conceptual Change {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

[**BUT...**]{.alert}

. . . 

Religion remains a powerful social force that guides individuals' decision. Many people deem **believe in God** is essentially needed for one to be **moral** [@tamirBeliefGodNecessary2020].

. . .

While scientists are **less likely** to be religious than the general population [@ecklundScienceVsReligion2010], many distinguished scientists are also faithful believers.

. . .

People at different ages and different cultures are found to engage in *both* **scientific and religious** explanations to explain various phenomena, even with or without scientific understanding. In psychology, we called this phenomenon [**explanatory coexistence**]{.alert}.

::: {.notes}
Pew Research Survey 2020, 34 countries - Indonesia was involved 96% Indonesians believe that belief in God is important to be moral and have good values.
:::

## Explanatory Coexistence {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

Adults and children in many different cultures are found to be more likely to engage in [**both**]{.alert} scientific and religious/supernatural explanation rather than with **only** scientific or religious explanations alone...

. . .

...most prominently to explain **death**, **illness**, and **origins** (e.g., *Why do people die? Why do people get sick? Where do we come from?*) [@legareCoexistenceNaturalSupernatural2012; @legareBewitchmentBiologyBoth2008].

. . .

This coexistence is observed even when **scientific literacy** is **present** and **salient** [@haimilaSupernaturalBeliefScientific2024].

. . .

According to explanatory coexistence hypothesis, individuals use scientific and religious explanations by applying different **'frameworks'** with varying levels of integration.

::: {.notes}

:::

## Explanatory Coexistence {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

These frameworks are:

- **Target-dependent thinking**: using scientific and religious explanations for addressing [**different aspects**]{.alert} of a phenomenon
- **Synthetic thinking**: [**partially**]{.alert} integrate scientific and religious explanations by loosely combining them
- **Integrative thinking**: [**fully**]{.alert} integrate scientific and religious explanation into a unified, coherent explanation

::: {.notes}
Examples:
1. TG -- my dad dies because of heart attack, now he lives in the afterlife
2. S -- my dad dies due to a heart attack AND God's will because he wants to remind us the risk of getting the same disease
3. I - when my dad dies, I saw his feet turning different color - maybe that means the soul is being pulled out by the angel from his head

## Deficient or adaptive? {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

:::{.callout-warning}

If scientific and religious beliefs are *competing* for our mental resources, [**why do they coexist**]{.alert} as observed by explanatory coexistence literature?

:::

. . .

Some people argue that the pervasiveness of religious beliefs in the face of scientific evidence is indicative of **deficient reasoning** due to incomplete learning, but more and more evidence shows that this is due to science and religion having **differential utility**.

::: {.notes}

:::

## Functional Differentiation {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

The pervasiveness of religious beliefs indicate that they **serve different roles**, thus people apply **different rules** when processing scientific and religious explanations.

. . . 

Science for epistemic purposes ('*to know*'), religion for non-epistemic purposes (e.g., moral, social, power, status) [@davoodiExplainingExistentialScientific2022].

. . .

Factual (scientific) beliefs are **involuntarily formed** in response to **evidence** and evaluated based on **truth-bearing quality**, while religious credence is **voluntarily chosen**, **context-dependent**, and evaluated based on **identity** and **normative values** rather than evidence [@vanleeuwenReligiousCredenceNot2014].

. . .

Religious explanations have **a lower evidentiary standard** [@lobatoReligiosityPredictsEvidentiary2020].

::: {.notes}

## Some Early Empirical Evidence (Zein & Gollwitzer, 2025) {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

We did an experiment involving **719 German participants**, where participants were presented with scientific and religious explanations of three incidents: **flood, climate crisis, and war**.

. . .

Participants then indicated to what extent they thought that each of these explanations useful.

. . .

We were testing **a motivated reasoning hypothesis**: religious participants would rated religious (vs. scientific) explanations as having higher utility, while non-religious people would indicate that scientific (vs. religious) explanation as being more useful.

::: {.notes}
People tend to value highly explanations that align with their prior belief.
:::

## Some Early Empirical Evidence (Zein & Gollwitzer, 2025) {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

*"Throughout history, human civilization has faced enormous collective adversity, including violent war. Millions of people have died, been displaced, and others have been indirectly affected by the devastating effects of violent war. “Why are there so many violent wars in the world?” you may ask. Below are plausible explanation(s) for the causes of violent war."*

. . . 

[Research on intergroup relations shows that collective memories of past conflicts, injustices, or humiliations can fuel war. When societies or groups focus on these historical grievances, they may seek revenge or retribution, perpetuating cycles of violence.]{.alert}

. . .

Although God teaches peace and reconciliation, He also allows wars as a means of restoring justice. People must be punished for some wrongdoings and are therefore allowed to punish each other. Therefore, war is something that is ultimately willed by God.

## Some Early Empirical Evidence (Zein & Gollwitzer, 2025) {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

Instead, this what we found

![](img/fig1.png)

::: {.notes}
Utility ratings of religious explanations vary depending on participants' religiosity.
:::

## What does this implicate? {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

- The motivated reasoning effect is **asymmetry** - only religious explanations are affected by religiosity.
- Scientific explanations are **virtually intact** - **religiosity didn't matter** when participants were asked to rate their perceived utility.
- Scientific explanations enjoy a kind of **universal acceptance**, while religious explanations don't.
- This explains why scientific and religious explanations **coexist**.

::: {.notes}

:::

## Summary {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

- People **can engage meaningfully** in both scientific and religious explanations, because..
  - They are useful for **different purposes**.
  - People apply **different rules** to scientific and religious beliefs when processing these two types of explanations.
  - Religious/supernatural beliefs, therefore, **cannot be completely replaced** by and **don't hinder** scientific understanding.

## Summary {background-image="img/background.png" background-size="contain"}

- Testimony is central to both scientific and religious belief acquisition, and **testimony doesn't work without trust** [@hendriksTrustScienceScience2016]. 
- How can we then **foster trust in the experts** for providing the public with scientific information useful for making decisions in many aspects of our life? [@altenmullerWhenResearchMesearch2021; @altenmullerScienceCommunicationGets2023]
