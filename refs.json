This article summarizes the available empirical evidence on the impact of instruction on the development and enhancement of critical thinking skills and dispositions and student achievement. The review includes 341 effects sizes drawn from quasi- or true-experimental studies that used standardized measures of CT as outcome variables. The weighted random effects mean effect size (g+) was 0.30 (p < .001). The collection was heterogeneous (p < .001). Results demonstrate that there are effective strategies for teaching CT skills, both generic and content specific, and CT dispositions, at all educational levels and across all disciplinary areas. Notably, the opportunity for dialogue, the exposure of students to authentic or situated problems and examples, and mentoring had positive effects on CT skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrami","given":"Philip C."},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Borokhovski","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Waddington","given":"David I."},{"family":"Wade","given":"C.

  {"id":"abramsMoralizationReligiosityExplains2020","abstract":"Religion is an enduring part of human culture, but religious belief is declining in some societies. What explains which regions secularize and which individuals leave their faiths? We propose that secularization is inversely related to the “moralization of religion:” the belief that religion is essential to morality. Moralization of religiosity likely emerged as a by-product of the historical rise of prosocial religions, but we propose that it has an additional side-effect—it discourages deconversion due to perceived reputational costs. We further suggest that cultural differences in the moralization of religiosity foreshadow patterns of nation-level secularization and individual-level deconversion. Our model is supported by historical cross-cultural, retrospective longitudinal, survey, and experimental studies (N = 221,202), which show that the moralization of religiosity inhibits both secularization across nations and deconversion across individuals, and also fosters prejudice against nonbelievers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrams","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Joshua Conrad"},{"family":"Vonasch","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"}],"citation-key":"abramsMoralizationReligiosityExplains2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/5a2db","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,5]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"Moralization of Religiosity Explains Worldwide Trends in Religious Belief","type":"report","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/5a2db/"},

  {"id":"adameConnectingAttitudesMotivating2020","abstract":"A growing body of research demonstrates that Vested Interest Theory (VIT) is a valuable framework for understanding audience messaging needs and can serve as a foundation for designing effective campaign messages. This chapter begins with an overview of VIT and its components, discusses recent developments in the theory's structure and application, and concludes with practical recommendations for applying VIT in communication campaigns and messaging interventions. The theory indicates that six variables (stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, self-efficacy, and response-efficacy) function to predict individuals' relative vestedness in a particular attitude or attitude-object. Research provides a plausible explanation of when attitudes are predictive of behavior, independent of attitude strength. Researchers have also attempted to manipulate perceived vestedness using a campaign-style message designed to motivate citizen-level hazard preparedness. VIT promises to be a valuable approach to measuring relevant attitudes and using them to motivate consonant behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Adame","given":"Bradley J."}],"citation-key":"adameConnectingAttitudesMotivating2020","container-title":"The Handbook of Applied Communication Research","DOI":"10.1002/9781119399926.ch3","ISBN":"978-1-119-39992-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","page":"47-62","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"3","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Connecting Attitudes and Motivating Behavior","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119399926.ch3"},

  {"id":"aghababaeiHonestyHumilityHEXACO2016","abstract":"Past research has shown that general and intrinsic religiosity is related to higher Big Five Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and, to some extent, Extraversion. With the rise of the six-factor HEXACO (Honesty–Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) model of personality, however, a more differentiated look at religiousness and personality is called for. It has been suggested that religiosity is more associated with Honesty–Humility than with Agreeableness. The new personality factor, Honesty–Humility has also been shown to have null or weak relations with happiness. In 5 studies involving 1375 participants from Iran, Poland, and Malaysia, the relations of Honesty–Humility and other HEXACO dimensions to religious orientation and well-being outcomes were investigated. As expected, Honesty–Humility was one of the strongest personality correlate of religiosity. Higher scores on religiousness were also associated with Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and to some extent, Extraversion showing that the main personality characteristics of religiosity are consistent across religious contexts and personality models. Relations of Honesty–Humility to psychological well-being scales were consistently positive and stronger than its relations to subjective well-being measures, suggesting that Honesty–Humility may not be “bad” for pleasure attainment and pain avoidance, but it is definitely “good” for living a virtuous, fully functioning life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Aghababaei","given":"Naser"},{"family":"Błachnio","given":"Agata"},{"family":"Arji","given":"Akram"},{"family":"Chiniforoushan","given":"Masoud"},{"family":"Tekke","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Fazeli Mehrabadi","given":"Alireza"}],"citation-key":"aghababaeiHonestyHumilityHEXACO2016","container-title":"Current Psychology","container-title-short":"Curr Psychol","DOI":"10.1007/s12144-015-9310-5","ISSN":"1936-4733","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"421-426","source":"Springer Link","title":"Honesty–Humility and the HEXACO Structure of Religiosity and Well-Being","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-015-9310-5","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"ainsimpsonBeliefDivineMoral2016","abstract":"Religion and morality have been deeply interwoven throughout human history. Although much research has investigated the role of religiosity (e.g., belief in God, prayer, religious attendance) in shaping moral concerns, only recently has research in psychology begun to delve deeper into the meta-ethical beliefs theists hold about the spiritual foundations of morality. The present research builds on moral–philosophical discourse on Divine Command Theory and recent work by Piazza and Landy (2013), who developed the 20-item Morality Founded on Divine Authority (MFDA) scale to measure Divine Command beliefs. We sought primarily to reduce the MFDA scale to increase its pragmatic utility; Confirmatory Factor Analysis revealed an optimal 5-item scale. Across four studies, this scale yielded levels of construct, convergent, and incremental validity equivalent to those of the 20-item scale. Compared with several other measures of religiosity and conservative thinking, the short MFDA was the strongest predictor of anti-atheist prejudice among U.S. religious believers and Indian Hindus (Studies 1a–1b) and largely explained religiosity's relationship with attitudes toward science (Study 1a) and moral cognitive outcomes including deontological reasoning (Study 2a) and prohibitive morality (Study 2b). We conclude with discussion about the practical utility of this scale in ongoing research into religion and moral cognition.","author":[{"literal":"Ain Simpson"},{"literal":"Jared Piazza"},{"literal":"Kimberly Rios"}],"citation-key":"ainsimpsonBeliefDivineMoral2016","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2016.01.032","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2289918793","title":"Belief in divine moral authority: Validation of a shortened scale with implications for social attitudes and moral cognition","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"aizenkotMeaningMakingChildLoss2022","abstract":"The study aimed to examine meaning-making of bereaved parents regarding the death of their adult child, as well as the coexistence of natural and supernatural explanatory frameworks used to attribute meaning to the death. The loss of a child is perceived as premature, against the laws of nature and a tragedy that could have been prevented. As such it is extremely difficult for parents to accept and comprehend. According to constructivist theory which views humans as meaning-makers by nature, parents attribute various meanings to the death of their child. Such meanings may include natural and supernatural explanatory frameworks. Although these explanations are often conceptualized in contradictory terms, considerable evidence indicates that the same individuals may use both explanations to make sense of their child's death, as there are multiple ways they can coexist in the human mind. A qualitative method was chosen to collect and analyze the relevant data. Fourteen Israeli couples, parents who experienced the sudden and unexpected loss of an adult child, participated in in-depth interviews. The interviews were analyzed with reference to a holistic-substantive narrative approach. The findings indicate that parents attribute various meanings to their child’s death, some supported by natural explanations (such as a tragic coincidence) and some based on supernatural explanations (e.g. divine intervention). The study also found that most participants use both natural and supernatural explanations concurrently to explain and give meaning to their child’s death. The research findings expand the understanding of the ways individuals perceive death and mortality. The findings also raise fundamental questions that future research may address, such as the relationship between natural and supernatural explanatory frameworks of death and emotional aspects of grief, the role of these explanatory frameworks in the continued relationship with the deceased child, and the relations between these frameworks and PTSD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Aizenkot","given":"Dana"}],"citation-key":"aizenkotMeaningMakingChildLoss2022","container-title":"Journal of Constructivist Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/10720537.2020.1819491","ISSN":"1072-0537","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,25]]},"page":"318-343","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Meaning-Making to Child Loss: The Coexistence of Natural and Supernatural Explanations of Death","title-short":"Meaning-Making to Child Loss","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10720537.2020.1819491","volume":"35"},

The substantial numbers of Muslim immigrants moving to the West and the fact that Muslim values are quite different from the secular system adopted by Europeans and Americans are more reasons why it is imperative to understand their attitudes toward Westerners. The present study examined and analyzed the relationship between two types of Muslim religiosity and prejudice toward the West in an Arab-Muslim context, a region that is dominated by Muslim believers. Further, the study also examined other associated constructs to prejudice on anti-Western attitudes. Religious Fundamentalism (RF) and the intrinsic component of the Intrinsic/Extrinsic (I/E-R) scale were both used to measure Muslim religi­ osity in an Arab-Muslim sample of 608 participants that were collected from 17 Arab countries. Also, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Dogmatism (DOG) were included to test their mediated effects on the relationship between Islamic religiosity and anti-Western attitudes. The results indicated that Islamic fundamentalism was the dominant predictor of unfavorable attitudes toward the West, followed by intrinsic Muslim religiosity and dog­ matism. The findings also showed that RWA and DOG partially mediated the relationship between intrinsic Muslim religiosity and anti-Western attitudes.

  {"id":"alganTrustScientistsTimes2021","abstract":"This article analyzes the specific and critical role of trust in scientists on both the support for and compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for 12 countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs and for favorable attitudes toward vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels and, in particular, trust in scientists have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs. Such findings point out the challenging but critical need to maintain trust in scientists during a lasting pandemic that strains citizens and governments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Algan","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Davoine","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Foucault","given":"Martial"},{"family":"Stantcheva","given":"Stefanie"}],"citation-key":"alganTrustScientistsTimes2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2108576118","issue":"40","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"page":"e2108576118","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Trust in scientists in times of pandemic: Panel evidence from 12 countries","title-short":"Trust in scientists in times of pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108576118","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"allumReligiousBeliefsKnowledge2014","abstract":"The use of genetics in medical research is one of the most important avenues currently being explored to enhance human health. For some, the idea that we can intervene in the mechanisms of human existence at such a fundamental level can be at minimum worrying and at most repugnant. In particular, religious doctrines are likely to collide with the rapidly advancing capability for science to make such interventions. The key ingredient for acceptance of genetics, on the other hand, is prototypically assumed to be scientific literacy – familiarity and understanding of the critical facts and methods of science. However, this binary opposition between science and religion runs counter to what is often found in practice. In this paper, we examine the association between religiosity, science knowledge and attitudes to medical genetics amongst the British public. In particular, we test the hypothesis that religion acts as a ‘perceptual filter’ through which citizens acquire and use scientific knowledge in the formation of attitudes towards medical genetics in various ways.","author":[{"family":"Allum","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Sibley","given":"Elissa"},{"family":"Sturgis","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Stoneman","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"allumReligiousBeliefsKnowledge2014","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","DOI":"10.1177/0963662513492485","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2038533565","page":"833– 849","PMID":"23838683","title":"Religious beliefs, knowledge about science and attitudes towards medical genetics","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

Although many studies, both quantitative and qualitative, have examined this issue, the results are at best diverse and at worst contradictory. In this paper, we review the evidence on the relationship between public attitudes and public knowledge about science across 40 countries using a meta-analytic approach. We fit multilevel models to data from 193 nationally representative surveys on PUS carried out since 1989. We find a small positive correlation between general attitudes towards science and general knowledge of scientific facts, after controlling for a range of possible confounding variables. This general relationship varies little across cultures but more substantially between different domains of science and technology. Our results suggest that PUS research needs to focus on understanding the mechanisms that underlie the clear association that exists between knowledge and attitudes about science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Allum","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Sturgis","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Tabourazi","given":"Dimitra"},{"family":"Brunton-Smith","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"allumScienceKnowledgeAttitudes2008","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662506070159","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"35-54","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: a meta-analysis","title-short":"Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662506070159","volume":"17"},

In two studies (N = 621), we investigate the circumstances under which learning about a researcher’s “me-search” increases or decreases laypeople’s ascriptions of trustworthiness and credibility to the respective researcher. Results suggest that participants’ own preexisting attitudes towards the research topic moderate the effects of “me-search” substantially: When participants hold favorable attitudes towards the research topic (i.e., LGBTQ or veganism), “me-searchers” were perceived as more trustworthy and their research was perceived as more credible. This pattern was reversed when participants held unfavorable attitudes towards the research topic.

In two studies (N = 743), we investigated whether this bias might be stronger in some people than others due to dispositional differences. Building on the assumptions that motivated science reception is driven by perceived threat and suspicion and higher under perceived ambiguity and uncertainty, we focused on traits associated with such perceptions. In particular, we tested the impact of conspiracy mentality and victim sensitivity on motivated science reception (as indicated by ascriptions of researchers’ trustworthiness and evidence credibility). In addition, we explored the role of broader personality traits (generalized mistrust and ambiguity intolerance) in this context. None of the investigated dispositions modulated the motivated science reception effect.

According to the theory of revivalreaction-politicization I propose, successful religious parties rise when major religious revivals confront social counter-mobilization and state repression, provided that existing political parties do not effectively represent religious defense.

We interviewed Indonesian 8- and 10-year-old children, lay adults, and medical expert adults, about the cause, contagiousness, and treatment of everyday illnesses: the common cold, the flu, and masuk angin. Most Indonesian children, and especially adults, believed that cold and flu are caused by germs and are contagious.

  {"id":"anvariReplicabilityCrisisPublic2018","abstract":"Replication failures of past findings in several scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and experimental economics, have created a “crisis of confidence” among scientists. Psychological science has been at the forefront of tackling these issues, with discussions about replication failures and scientific self-criticisms of questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the public’s trust is a question yet to be answered by research. Whereas some researchers believe that the public’s trust will be positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will be diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on trust in psychological science. We performed a study testing how public trust in past and future psychological research would be impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures (replications group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii) replication failures, criticisms of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group). Results from a mostly European sample (N = 1129) showed that, compared to a control group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups self-reported less trust in past research. Regarding trust in future research, the replications and QRPs groups did not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly, the reforms group had less trust in future research than the control group. Nevertheless, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups did not significantly differ from the control group in how much they believed future research in psychological science should be supported by public funding.

As the motive for radical Islamism is to replace the existing political authority and to restore an Islamist sense of justice, it differs from the moderate forms of Islam as exemplified by the socio-religious organizations. First, this chapter will discuss the political sites of radical Islamism within the context of Indonesia. Second, it will examine common characteristics of radical Islamism. It will then discuss the theological roots of radical Islamism and how such views shape the way the Islamists relate to the state’s imposition of the Pancasila as the ideological foundation of the state. Finally, this chapter concludes by investigating how the War on Terror exacerbates the Islamists’ quest for the political Islam and how it fuels the rising discursive narrative of the Western conspiracy against Islam and Muslims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Anwar","given":"Etin"}],"citation-key":"anwarQuestRadicalIslamism2021","container-title":"The (De)Legitimization of Violence in Sacred and Human Contexts","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-51125-8_11","editor":[{"family":"Shafiq","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Donlin-Smith","given":"Thomas"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-51125-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"175-194","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Quest for Radical Islamism and the War on Terror in Indonesia","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51125-8_11"},
  {"id":"aquinoSelfimportanceMoralIdentity2002a","abstract":"Recent theorizing in moral psychology extends rationalist models by calling attention to social and cultural influences (J. Haidt, 2001). Six studies using adolescents, university students, and adults measured the associations among the self-importance of moral identity, moral cognitions, and behavior. The psychometric properties of the measure were assessed through an examination of the underlying factor structure (Study 1) and convergent, nomological, and discriminant validity analyses (Studies 2 and 3). The predictive validity of the instrument was assessed by examinations of the relationships among the self-importance of moral identity, various psychological outcomes, and behavior (Studies 4, 5, and 6). The results are discussed in terms of models of moral behavior, social identity measurement, and the need to consider moral self-conceptions in explaining moral conduct.","author":[{"family":"Aquino","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Americus"}],"citation-key":"aquinoSelfimportanceMoralIdentity2002a","container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"J Pers Soc Psychol","DOI":"10.1037//0022-3514.83.6.1423","ISSN":"0022-3514","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"1423-1440","PMID":"12500822","source":"PubMed","title":"The self-importance of moral identity","type":"article-journal","volume":"83"},
  {"id":"arbuckleInteractionReligionPolitical2017","abstract":"Political ideology and religion are considered important influences on attitudes about climate change, as many people rely on ideological and religious cues to help shape attitudes about this highly complex, uncertain, and politicized issue. While many scholars have studied the impacts of political orientation and religious affiliation independently, few have studied whether and how they interact in shaping concern about climate change. This article uses a large sample study to examine the impact of religious tradition on two indicators of concern about climate change within categories of political ideology. This study shows that religious affiliation moderates the impact of ideology, and that these interaction effects vary across religious traditions. Perhaps most significantly, this study reveals that religious affiliation is most influential on political liberals but has very little impact on conservatives. This holds significant implications for the way we understand the relationship between religion and environmental attitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Arbuckle","given":"Matthew B."}],"citation-key":"arbuckleInteractionReligionPolitical2017","container-title":"Society & Natural Resources","DOI":"10.1080/08941920.2016.1209267","ISSN":"0894-1920","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"page":"177-194","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Interaction of Religion, Political Ideology, and Concern About Climate Change in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2016.1209267","volume":"30"},

To that end, we conducted an experiment in 16 countries across 6 continents (N = 34,286; 676,605 observations) to investigate predictors of susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19, and interventions to combat the spread of this misinformation. In every country, participants with a more analytic cognitive style and stronger accuracy-related motivations were better at discerning truth from falsehood; valuing democracy was also associated with greater truth discernment, whereas endorsement of individual responsibility over government support was negatively associated with truth discernment in most countries. Subtly prompting people to think about accuracy had a generally positive effect on the veracity of news that people were willing to share across countries, as did minimal digital literacy tips. Finally, aggregating the ratings of our non-expert participants was able to differentiate true from false headlines with high accuracy in all countries via the ‘wisdom of crowds’. The consistent patterns we observe suggest that the psychological factors underlying the misinformation challenge are similar across different regional settings, and that similar solutions may be broadly effective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Arechar","given":"Antonio A."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Berinsky","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Cole","given":"Rocky"},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Ziv"},{"family":"Garimella","given":"Kiran"},{"family":"Gully","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jackson G."},{"family":"Ross","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Stagnaro","given":"Michael N."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yunhao"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"arecharUnderstandingCombattingMisinformation2023","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","container-title-short":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-023-01641-6","ISSN":"2397-3374","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"9","page":"1502-1513","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Understanding and combatting misinformation across 16 countries on six continents","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01641-6","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"arendStatisticalPowerTwolevel2019","abstract":"The estimation of power in two-level models used to analyze data that are hierarchically structured is particularly complex because the outcome contains variance at two levels that is regressed on predictors at two levels. Methods for the estimation of power in two-level models have been based on formulas and Monte Carlo simulation. We provide a hands-on tutorial illustrating how a priori and post hoc power analyses for the most frequently used two-level models are conducted. We describe how a population model for the power analysis can be specified by using standardized input parameters and how the power analysis is implemented in SIMR, a very flexible power estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we provide case-sensitive rules of thumb for deriving sufficient sample sizes as well as minimum detectable effect sizes that yield a power ≥ .80 for the effects and input parameters most frequently analyzed by psychologists. For medium variance components, the results indicate that with lower level (L1) sample sizes up to 30 and higher level (L2) sample sizes up to 200, medium and large fixed effects can be detected. However, small L2 direct- or cross-level interaction effects cannot be detected with up to 200 clusters.

The data demonstrated a negative correlation between attitude towards religion and attitude towards science. However, this negative correlation was transformed into a positive correlation after taking into account individual differences in the students’ views about scientism and creationism. The implications of this finding are discussed in the context of the increasing support within society for the teaching of alternatives to evolution within the science curriculum.

All participants were living in rural Madagascar in a community where ancestral beliefs and practices are widespread. In Study 1, children (8–17 years) and adults (19–71 years) were asked whether bodily and mental processes continue after death. The death in question was presented in the context of a narrative that focused either on the corpse or on the ancestral practices associated with the afterlife. Participants aged 8 years and older claimed that death brings an end to most bodily and mental processes. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of the religious narrative, they claimed that certain mental processes continue even after death. This assertion of an afterlife was more evident among adults than children, especially with respect to cognitive processes, such as knowing and remembering. In Study 2, 5- and 7-year-olds were asked similar questions in connection with the death of a bird and a person. Seven-year-olds consistently claimed that bodily and mental processes cease at death, whereas 5-year-olds were unsystematic in their replies.

In six studies (N = 1945) we examine the structural validity of the Persian translation of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, compare moral foundations between Iran and the US, conduct qualitative interviews regarding moral values, expand the nomological network of “Qeirat” as a culture-specific set of moral values, and investigate the pragmatic validity of “Qeirat” in Iranian culture. Our findings suggest an additional moral foundation in Iran, above and beyond the five foundations identified by MFT. Specifically, qualitative studies highlighted the role of “Qeirat” values in Iranian culture, which are comprised of guarding and protectiveness of female kin, romantic partners, broader family, and country. Significant cultural differences in moral values are argued in this work to follow from the psychological systems that, when brought to interact with particular socio-ecological environments, produce different moral structures.

The aim of the study was to document the knowledge of healthcare professionals of the HPV vaccine and its acceptability. It was a cross-sectional study in three of the six geo-political zones of Nigeria, carried out between June 2010 and January 2011. The 602 adult Nigerian respondents were made up of 147 (24.4%) males and 455 (75.6%) females aged 20-57 years, with a mean of 34.3 ± 7.9 years; most were under 40 years (70.1%) and married (n = 394; 65.5%). In total, 548 (91%) were aware of HPV; 83.4% knew HPV as an STI; 78.2% knew HPV can cause cervical cancer but only 265 (44.0%) were aware of the HPV vaccine. Among the healthcare professionals studied, nurses were the least aware of the existence of the HPV vaccine (χ(2) = 1.54, p = 0.001). A total of 489 (81.0%) would approve HPV vaccine for their teenage daughters. The men were more likely to accept the vaccination of their daughters than the women (χ(2) = 14.76, p = 0.002). The unmarried were more favourably disposed to vaccination of teenagers than the married (χ(2) = 27.37, p = 0.001). Safety concerns were the commonest reasons expressed by the 7% who were reluctant to accept the vaccination of their teenage daughters. In conclusion, healthcare providers are the custodians of health in a community, yet have low knowledge of a vaccine that can prevent the commonest cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa.","author":[{"family":"Audu","given":"B.

  {"id":"avraamidouScienceIdentityLandscape2020","abstract":"In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis on recognition and emotions, as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Avraamidou","given":"Lucy"}],"citation-key":"avraamidouScienceIdentityLandscape2020","container-title":"Cultural Studies of Science Education","container-title-short":"Cult Stud of Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11422-019-09954-7","ISSN":"1871-1510","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"323-345","source":"Springer Link","title":"Science identity as a landscape of becoming: rethinking recognition and emotions through an intersectionality lens","title-short":"Science identity as a landscape of becoming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11422-019-09954-7","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"avraamidouWhoAspiresBe2021","abstract":"Our purpose in this paper is to put forward an argument about both the need and the value for understanding how the constructs of science identity and the nature of science (NOS) might intersect and intertwine and offer useful insights about science participation in times of crises. Based on our knowledge and understanding of these two research areas, we maintain that science identity research has not been fully engaged in understanding how perspectives on NOS might be intersecting with the questions of who can be (or not) a scientist and who is allowed (or not) in science. In this paper, we argue that the formation of a disrupting science identity that challenges existing constructed systems of power in science, requires robust understandings of NOS that place emphasis on the socially-produced narratives about science and scientists. In doing so, we engage with the following questions: (a) How have understandings of NOS contributed to conceptualizations of who can be a scientist and who is recognized as a scientist? (b) How have these conceptualizations contributed to producing exclusionary narratives and perpetuating inequalities in science? and, (c) How might an exploration of NOS through the lens of science identity be used to promote goals related to equity and social justice?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Avraamidou","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Renee"}],"citation-key":"avraamidouWhoAspiresBe2021","container-title":"Cultural Studies of Science Education","container-title-short":"Cult Stud of Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11422-021-10059-3","ISSN":"1871-1510","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"337-344","source":"Springer Link","title":"Who aspires to be a scientist/who is allowed in science?

  {"id":"ayubBridgingScienceSpirituality2023","abstract":"Background\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had global impacts on social interactions and religious activities, leading to a complex relationship between religion and public health policies. This article reviews impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on religious activities and beliefs in relation to the spread of the virus, as well as the potential of religious leaders and faith communities in mitigating the impact of the pandemic through public health measures and community engagement.\n\nMethods\nA literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar, with search terms including “religion,” “COVID-19,” “pandemic,” “coronavirus,” and “spirituality.” We included English articles published between January 2020 and September 2022, focusing on intersection of religion and COVID-19.\n\nResults\nWe identified two main themes emerging, with the selected 32 studies divided in 15 studies focused on the relationship between religious practices, beliefs, and the spread of COVID-19, while 17 studies explored the role of religious leaders and faith communities in coping with and mitigating the impact of COVID-19. Religious activities were found to correlate with virus spread, particularly in early days of the pandemic. The relationship between religiosity and adherence to government guidelines was mixed, with some studies suggesting increased religiosity contributed to misconceptions about the virus and resistance to restrictions. Religious beliefs were also associated with vaccine hesitancy, particularly conservative religious beliefs. On the other hand, religious leaders and communities played a crucial role in adapting to COVID-19 measures, maintaining a sense of belonging, fostering emotional resilience, and upholding compliance with public health measures. The importance of collaboration between religious leaders, institutions, and public health officials in addressing the pandemic was emphasized.\n\nConclusions\nThis review highlights the essential role of religious leaders, faith-based organizations, and faith communities in promoting education, preparedness, and response efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Engaging with religious leaders and communities can improve pandemic control and prevention efforts. Collaboration between religious leaders, governments, and healthcare professionals is necessary to combat vaccine hesitancy and ensure successful COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. The insights from this review can guide future research, policy development, and public health interventions to minimize the impact of the pandemic and improve outcomes for individuals and communities affected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ayub","given":"Shahana"},{"family":"Anugwom","given":"Gibson O."},{"family":"Basiru","given":"Tajudeen"},{"family":"Sachdeva","given":"Vishi"},{"family":"Muhammad","given":"Nazar"},{"family":"Bachu","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Trudeau","given":"Maxwell"},{"family":"Gulati","given":"Gazal"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Saeed"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Lakshit"}],"citation-key":"ayubBridgingScienceSpirituality2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1183234","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,19]]},"page":"1183234","PMCID":"PMC10236196","PMID":"37275970","publisher":"Frontiers","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Bridging science and spirituality: the intersection of religion and public health in the COVID-19 pandemic","title-short":"Bridging science and spirituality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10236196/","volume":"14"},

To gauge ideological and psychological variability in attitudes toward science, we conducted an extensive analysis of public opinion data based on a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,500) and a large replication sample (N = 2,119). We estimated the unique effects of partisanship, symbolic and operational forms of political ideology, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and general system justification (GSJ), after adjusting for demographic factors. Multiverse analyses revealed that (a) conservatism and SDO were significant predictors of distrust of climate science in > 99.9% of model specifications, with conservatism accounting for 80% of the total variance; (b) conservatism, RWA, religiosity, (male) sex, (low) education, (low) income, and distrust of climate science were significant predictors of skepticism about science in general (vs. faith) in > 99.9% of model specifications; (c) conservatism, RWA, (low) education, and distrust of climate science were significant predictors of trust in ordinary people (over scientific experts) > 99.9% of the time; and (d) GSJ was a significant predictor of trust in scientific experts (over ordinary people) 81% of the time, after adjusting for all other demographic and ideological factors.

Compared to the more utilitarian non-believers, religious believers tend to endorse a meta-ethics rooted in deontic rules and views of objective moral truths. Believers are also more likely to endorse authority, loyalty and purity as motives for moral concern. The moral importance of prosocial behavior, however, is endorsed across the religiosity spectrum. Religiosity is associated with higher self-reports, but not behavioral measures of prosocial behavior. This discrepancy can be explained on the one hand by a tendency for the religious to be higher in impression management and self-enhancement, and on the other hand by a failure of lab-based behavioral tasks to capture the real life circumstances under which religion inspires prosocial behavior.","author":[{"literal":"Azim F.

  {"id":"azizAttitudeVaccinationCrosssectional2019","abstract":"Purpose: To evaluate parent’s attitude towards childhood vaccination and to determine the factors associated with non-adherence of parents to the mandatory vaccination schedule in Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia. Methods: a Validated questionnaire was used as an instrument for evaluating parent’s attitude regarding childhood vaccination. Data obtained was classified based on Bloom’s cut-off point for determining parents’ attitude. For the analysis of data SPSS version 20 was used and Pvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: a total of 396 parent’s attitude was evaluated for obtaining different factors associated with the unscheduled vaccination. A significant difference was observed in parents attitude based on gender (Pvalue = 0.0.21). It was found that parent’s income has a prominent impact on the parent’s attitude and can be considered as a potential barrier in the provision of proper immunization of children against fatal diseases (Ф= 0.329, P-value <0.001). By education level, parents in the postgraduate level of education were having a good attitude (SD ± 4.15, Mean Rank = 39.01) in comparison to other categories of educational background (P-value <0.001). A significant difference was observed among the parents living in rural and urban areas (P-value<0.001, Ф = 0.298). No significant association found based on religious beliefs or ethnicity. Conclusion: Lack of parents’ belief in vaccines and their unawareness affects their attitude towards childhood vaccination. Educating parents through interactive mass media awareness campaigns can help eliminate public health issues related to vaccine-preventable diseases.","author":[{"family":"Aziz","given":"S."},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"M.

  {"id":"baerndtDrinkingPartyingYoung2021","abstract":"Background and aims\nDanish youth drinking culture is characterized by a very high level of alcohol consumption and a focus on intoxication. Young people with Muslim backgrounds drink markedly less, but their experiences with drinking and partying have been overlooked in research concerned with youth drinking. The aim of this paper is to investigate how young Danish Muslim women experience being part of a youth culture of intoxication and how they navigate through processes of exclusion related to drinking and partying. Special attention is paid to the intersections of different social positions relevant to these processes of exclusion in drinking and partying contexts.\nMethods\nTwenty-five in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 young Danish Muslim women (mean age 23 years) residing mainly in big cities and surrounding areas. An intersectional case study design approach was applied to investigate how certain identities become salient at particular moments or within particular contexts.\nResults\nThe Danish normalized youth culture of intoxication had various consequences for our participants, of which two stand out. First, this culture of intoxication was excluding for young Muslim women and, furthermore, seemed to enhance exclusion based on ethnicity and religion, regardless of whether our participants drank alcohol or abstained. Second, the culture of intoxication actualized gendered ideals within the young women's families, and the potential for conflicts pertaining to drinking and partying could call into doubt their experiences of belonging to a local ethno-religious community.\nDiscussion\nDue to the Danish normalized youth culture of intoxication, young Muslim women are at risk of several exclusions: exclusion from central Danish youth contexts and, potentially, from their religious and cultural roots. We discuss the importance of including agency and strategic manoeuvring in intersectional approaches because these contribute to a better understanding of the complexity found in the results and, furthermore, they help to avoid the pitfalls of determinism and essentialism in studies of minorities. We also discuss how binge drinking prevention initiatives could focus not only on health warnings but also on the social consequences of exclusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bærndt","given":"Marie Fjellerup"},{"family":"Kolind","given":"Torsten"}],"citation-key":"baerndtDrinkingPartyingYoung2021","container-title":"International Journal of Drug Policy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Drug Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103170","ISSN":"0955-3959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103170","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Drinking and partying among young Muslim women: Exclusion in the context of a normalized youth drinking culture","title-short":"Drinking and partying among young Muslim women","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395921000682","volume":"93"},

Several recent studies, however, challenged this finding claiming, for example, that the presumed association is an artifact of the order of presentation of the ACS and religiosity measures or that ACS might be differently related to different types of religiosity. Furthermore, almost all data in this field of research come from Western Christian samples. We, therefore, investigated whether ACS is related to four types of religiosity (intrinsic, extrinsic, quest, and general religious belief) and whether this relation stems from an order effect in three different studies with four different non-western samples (total n=1329). The results reveal that there is no order effect and that ACS is negatively correlated to intrinsic/extrinsic religiosity and general religious belief, corroborating initial findings. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between ACS and quest religiosity.

We show that Christian nationalism—meaning the desire to see particularistic and exclusivist versions of Christian symbols, values, and policies enshrined as the established religion of the United States—is a strong and consistent predictor of Americans’ attitudes about science above and beyond other religious and political characteristics. Further, a majority of the overall effect of political ideology on skepticism about the moral authority of science is mediated through Christian nationalism, indicating that political conservatives are more likely to be concerned with particular aspects of science primarily because they are more likely to be Christian nationalists. Likewise, substantial proportions of the well-documented associations between religiosity and biblical “literalism” with views of science are mediated through Christian nationalism. Because Christian nationalism seeks to establish a particular and exclusivist vision of Christianity as the dominant moral order, adherents feel threatened by challenges to the epistemic authority undergirding that order, including by aspects of science perceived as challenging the supremacy of biblicist authority.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Joseph O."},{"family":"Perry","given":"Samuel L."},{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Andrew L."}],"citation-key":"bakerCrusadingMoralAuthority2020","container-title":"Sociological Forum","DOI":"10.1111/socf.12619","ISSN":"1573-7861","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"587-607","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Crusading for Moral Authority: Christian Nationalism and Opposition to Science","title-short":"Crusading for Moral Authority","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/socf.12619","volume":"35"},

They hold that all typologies are too simple and too static to illuminate the complex and changing historical interactions of science and religion. I argue that typologies serve a useful pedagogical function even though every particular interaction must be seen in its historical context. I acknowledge the problems in making distinctions between categories of classification and examine some alternative typologies that have been proposed.

  {"id":"barnesAreScientistsBiased2020","abstract":"Christians are one of the most underrepresented groups in science, and one potential explanation is that scientists have a bias against Christian students, which could discourage and actively prevent Christian students from becoming scientists. Although there is a general perception in society that there is bias against Christians in science, we do not know whether science students, who frequently interact with scientists, perceive this bias. Further, no researchers have attempted to experimentally document the existence of bias against Christians in science. To address these gaps in the literature, we designed three studies. In the first study, we found that college science students report a perceived bias against Christians in science and that evangelical Christians perceive greater bias than Catholic and non-Christian students. Then in two studies, biology professors evaluated Ph.D. program applicants and we examined whether the professors rated a student less favorably when the student revealed a Christian religious identity. We found no statistically significant differences in how biology professors rated a student who was President of the Christian Association compared to a student who was President of the Atheist Association or a student who was President of the Activities Association. However, in Study 3, biology professors did rate a Christian student who went on a mission trip with Campus Crusade for Christ as less hireable, less competent, and less likeable than a student who did not reveal a Christian identity. Taken together, these studies indicate that perceived bias against Christians in science may contribute to underrepresentation of Christians but actual bias against Christians in science may be restricted to a specific type of Christianity that scientists call fundamentalist and/or evangelical.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnes","given":"M.

AOT is important for good citizenship for three reasons: it provides a prescription for individual thinking about political decisions; it serves as a social norm (when others agree); and, perhaps most importantly, it provides a standard for knowing which sources to trust, including politicians and pundits. I provide a current account of AOT as a general prescriptive theory that defines a standard or norm for all thinking, with emphasis on its role in the judgment of the thinking of others, and in maintaining appropriate confidence. I also contrast AOT with other standards. AOT does not assume that more thinking is always better, and it implies that low confidence in the results of thinking is often warranted and beneficial. I discuss the measurement of AOT and its relation to politics.

Because the thinking of citizens and oﬃcials aﬀects political decisions, good thinking is a moral virtue, like honesty. AOT standards have two functions: people try to follow their own standards; and they apply these standards to the evaluation of the thinking of others. The second function is especially important in public policy, where most of us often “outsource” our thinking to others. Individual diﬀerences in AOT primarily involve two dimensions: open-mindedness, avoiding “myside bias”; and overconﬁdence in a favored conclusion. The most dangerous political beliefs are those that are held with great conﬁdence despite minimal or biased thinking. Here we review the recent literature on the role of AOT as a standard, and the correlations between AOT measures and particular political beliefs, such as acceptance of conspiracy theories. We argue for a “positive manifold” in which Enlightenment-based ideas about thinking and politics are all correlated with each other. We then report a study that tries to ﬁnd the source of individual diﬀerences in this sort of “cognitive liberalism” and associated beliefs, comparing two major accounts: cultural background and thinking by oneself. We ﬁnd evidence for both inﬂuences. But people often regard themselves as rebelling against their background, despite its actual inﬂuence on them.","author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Isler","given":"Ozan"},{"family":"Yılmaz","given":"Onurcan"}],"citation-key":"baronActivelyOpenmindedThinking2023","container-title":"Divided: Open-Mindedness and Dogmatism in a Polarized World","editor":[{"family":"Ottati","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Chadly"}],"event-place":"Oxford","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Zotero","title":"Actively open-minded thinking and the political eﬀects of its absence","type":"chapter"},

(this issue, p. 273) conclude that ideological bias is equivalent on the left and right of U.S. politics. In this commentary, we contend that this conclusion does not follow from the review and that Ditto and his colleagues are too quick to embrace a false equivalence between the liberal left and the conservative right. For one thing, the issues, procedures, and materials used in the studies reviewed by Ditto and his colleagues were selected for purposes other than the inspection of ideological asymmetries. Consequently, methodological choices made by researchers were systematically biased to avoid producing differences between liberals and conservatives. We also consider the broader implications of a normative analysis of judgment and decision making and demonstrate that the bias examined by Ditto and his colleagues is not, in fact, an irrational bias, and that it is incoherent to discuss bias in the absence of standards for assessing accuracy and consistency. Other conclusions about domain-general asymmetries in motivated social cognition have suggested that epistemic virtues are more prevalent among liberals than conservatives, and these conclusions are closer to the truth of the matter when it comes to current American politics. Finally, we question the notion that the research literature in psychology is necessarily characterized by liberal bias, as several authors have claimed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"baronFalseEquivalenceAre2019","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691618788876","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"292-303","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"False Equivalence: Are Liberals and Conservatives in the United States Equally Biased?","title-short":"False Equivalence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691618788876","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"baronTwoComponentsIndividual","abstract":"The theory of actively open-minded thinking (AOT) implies standards for good thinking. Two broad aspects of these standards characterize individual diﬀerences in their acceptance: myside bias, in which thinking favors possible conclusions that are already strong; and uncertainty aversion, a belief that good thinking results in high conﬁdence. Acceptance of AOT standards is often measured with short questionnaire scales. The present paper reports one study focusing on each of these two biases in the evaluation of the trustworthiness of sources, on the basis of short statements diﬀering in signs of myside bias or of unjustiﬁed overconﬁdence. A 10-item scale measuring largely myside bias predicts sensitivity to both sources of diﬀerence in the statements. A third study examines the generality of the two standards across topics. The study used four questions about each topic and an 11-item scale with more items about uncertainty aversion. Individual diﬀerences are preserved across topic, although some results imply that that individual diﬀerences are more pronounced when a standard is seen as more relevant to the content. The two standards are best characterized as two unidimensional factors that are correlated with each other. Thus, individual diﬀerences in AOT standards are not unidimensional.","author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"baronTwoComponentsIndividual","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Two components of individual diﬀerences in actively open-minded thinking standards: Myside bias and uncertainty aversion","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"baronWhyDoesCognitive2015","abstract":"The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is thought to correlate with measures of utilitarian moral judgment because it measures system-2 correction of an initial intuitive response. And some theories of moral judgment hold that the same thing often happens when people arrive a utilitarian judgments. We find, however, that CRT-type items (using logic as well as arithmetic) can work just as well when they do not have obvious intuitive answers at predicting utilitarian moral judgment, assessed with self-report questionnaires as well as with hypothetical scenarios, and also at predicting a measure of actively open-minded thinking (AOT). Moreover, long response times, as well as high accuracy, also predict moral judgment and other outcomes. The CRT might thus be considered a test of reflection-impulsivity (RI). However, RI is only part of AOT, because RI is concerned only with the amount of thinking, not its direction. Tests of AOT also predict utilitarian moral judgments. Individual differences in AOT and moral judgments are both strongly (negatively) associated with belief that morality comes from God and cannot be understood through thought. The correlation of CRT and utilitarian judgment, when found, is thus likely due to the (imperfect) correlation of AOT and CRT. Intuition in these domains is thus not necessarily something that people overcome through additional thinking, but rather what they rely on when they do not think very much.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Sydney"},{"family":"Fincher","given":"Katrina"},{"family":"Emlen Metz","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"baronWhyDoesCognitive2015","collection-title":"Modeling and Aiding Intuition in Organizational Decision Making","container-title":"Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","container-title-short":"Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.jarmac.2014.09.003","ISSN":"2211-3681","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"265-284","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Why does the Cognitive Reflection Test (sometimes) predict utilitarian moral judgment (and other things)?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368114000801","volume":"4"},

However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine when and under what circumstances errors are detected and how they are corrected. The present study investigated thought experiments as a potential tool that can reveal errors and trigger belief revision in the service of error correction. Across two experiments, 1149 participants engaged in reasoning about force and motion (a domain with well-documented misconceptions) in a pre-training?training?post-training design. The two experiments manipulated the type of mental model manipulated in the thought experiments (i.e., whether participants reasoned about forces acting on their own bodies vs. on external objects), as well as the level of relational and argumentative reasoning about the outcomes of the thought experiments. The results showed that: (i) thought experiments can serve as a tool to elicit inconsistencies in one's representations; (ii) the level of relational and argumentative reasoning determines the level of belief revision in the service of error correction; and (iii) the type of mental model manipulated in a thought experiment determines its outcome and its potential to initiate belief revision. Thought experiments can serve as a valuable teaching and learning tool, and they can help us better understand the nature of error detection and correction systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bascandziev","given":"Igor"}],"citation-key":"bascandzievThoughtExperimentsError2024","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/cogs.13401","ISSN":"0364-0213","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"page":"e13401","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Thought Experiments as an Error Detection and Correction Tool","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13401","volume":"48"},

Some researchers have proposed that this topic is best addressed by focusing on sociocognitive conflict. To prepare new learning opportunities for this approach, it is necessary to know the concrete arguments that students use in their discussions on this issue. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic description of these arguments. For this purpose, upper secondary students (N = 43) argued for either the acceptance of evolutionary theory or faith in Genesis in a written speech. The study was conducted during their regular biology and religious education classes. Generated arguments were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Three dimensions of the arguments were described: the content (science or religion), the valuation of the argument (positive or negative), and whether the argument consisted of a descriptive or normative argumentation. The results indicate that students found it easier to generate arguments about the scientific side of the issue; however, these arguments were negatively constructed. The results are discussed with regard to implications for educational approaches for teaching controversial issues at the high-school level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Basel","given":"Nicolai"},{"family":"Harms","given":"Ute"},{"family":"Prechtl","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Weiß","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Rothgangel","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"baselStudentsArgumentsScience2014","container-title":"Journal of Biological Education","DOI":"10.1080/00219266.2013.849286","ISSN":"0021-9266","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,2]]},"page":"179-187","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Students’ arguments on the science and religion issue: the example of evolutionary theory and Genesis","title-short":"Students’ arguments on the science and religion issue","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00219266.2013.849286","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"bauerParadigmResearchSocial1999","abstract":"Based on Moscovici’s (1961) classical study on the cultivation of psychoanalytic ideas in France in the 1950’s and our own research on modern biotechnology, we propose a paradigm for researching social representations. Following a consideration of the nature of representations and of the ‘iconoclastic suspicion’ that haunts them, we propose a model of the emergence of meaning relating three elements: subjects, objects, and projects. The basic unit of analysis is the elongated triangle of mediation (SOPS): subject 1, object, project, and subject 2, captured in the image of a ‘Toblerone’. Such social units cultivate, that is produce, circulate and receive representation which may be embodied in four modes–habitual behaviour, individual cognition, informal communication and formal communication–and in three mediums–words, visual images or non-linguistic sounds. We propose an operational definition of a ‘social representation’ as the comparison of four characteristics of communication systems: the content structures (anchorings and objectifications; core and peripheral elements), the typified processes (diffusion, propagation, propaganda etc.), and their functions (identity, attitude, opinion, resistance, ideology etc.), within the context of segmented social milieus. Seven implications for research on social representations are outlined: (1) content and process; (2) segmentation by social milieus rather than taxonomies; (3) cultivation studies within social milieus; (4) multi-method (mode and medium) analysis; (5) time structures and longitudinal data; (6) the crossover of cultural projects and trajectories; (7) the disinterested research attitude. This ideal type paradigm leads to an operational clarification to identify new research questions, and to guide the design and evaluation of studies on social representations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Martin W."},{"family":"Gaskell","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"bauerParadigmResearchSocial1999","container-title":"Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour","DOI":"10.1111/1468-5914.00096","ISSN":"1468-5914","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"163-186","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Towards a Paradigm for Research on Social Representations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-5914.00096","volume":"29"},

However, decisions about vaccination are based on more than mere knowledge of risks, costs, and benefits. Individual decision making about vaccinating involves many other factors including those related to emotion, culture, religion, and socio-political context. In this paper, we use a nationally representative internet survey in the U.S. to investigate socio-political characteristics to assess attitudes about vaccination. In particular, we consider how political ideology and trust affect opinions about vaccinations for flu, pertussis, and measles. Our findings demonstrate that ideology has a direct effect on vaccine attitudes. In particular, conservative respondents are less likely to express pro-vaccination beliefs than other individuals. Furthermore, ideology also has an indirect effect on immunization propensity.

  {"id":"bavelImportanceMoralConstrual2012","abstract":"Over the past decade, intuitionist models of morality have challenged the view that moral reasoning is the sole or even primary means by which moral judgments are made. Rather, intuitionist models posit that certain situations automatically elicit moral intuitions, which guide moral judgments. We present three experiments showing that evaluations are also susceptible to the influence of moral versus non-moral construal. We had participants make moral evaluations (rating whether actions were morally good or bad) or non-moral evaluations (rating whether actions were pragmatically or hedonically good or bad) of a wide variety of actions. As predicted, moral evaluations were faster, more extreme, and more strongly associated with universal prescriptions—the belief that absolutely nobody or everybody should engage in an action—than non-moral (pragmatic or hedonic) evaluations of the same actions. Further, we show that people are capable of flexibly shifting from moral to non-moral evaluations on a trial-by-trial basis. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that moral versus non-moral construal has an important influence on evaluation and suggests that effects of construal are highly flexible. We discuss the implications of these experiments for models of moral judgment and decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bavel","given":"Jay J.

They tend to find fault in unfavorable information and accept favorable information less critically. This may especially be the case when individuals? positions are held with moral conviction?that is, when their position is not only their preferred position, but when it is the position that they feel to be morally correct. I examine three areas in which allowing moral convictions to influence reactions to scientific information may actually threaten the social benefits of science: promoting science misperceptions, eroding the credibility of scientists as sources of information, and eroding evaluations of science as a process. I argue that dealing with the influence of moral conviction over scientific interpretation will require acknowledgement that the social benefits of science are not self-evident and that they depend on public buy-in.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bayes","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"bayesMoralConvictionsThreats2022","container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/00027162221083514","ISSN":"0002-7162","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"86-96","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Moral Convictions and Threats to Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027162221083514","volume":"700"},
  {"id":"bayesMotivatedReasoningClimate2021","abstract":"Despite a strong scientific consensus, there remains a substantial partisan divide in the U.S. regarding belief in, and attitudes toward, human-caused climate change. A preeminent explanation of this phenomenon is directional ‘motivated reasoning’, in which new information is processed in service of reaching a pre-determined, desired conclusion. Much existing work theorizes that partisan polarization occurs because members of the two political parties are assimilating new information to fulfill different desired conclusions, rooted in different party norms, values, or prior standing beliefs. However, recent work challenges this account. The next generation of work on motivated reasoning and climate change beliefs must address these challenges by distinguishing between distinct motivations that may drive motivated reasoning—most significantly, by identifying when partisans are truly striving to reach a desired conclusion and when they are striving to be accurate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bayes","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Druckman","given":"James N"}],"citation-key":"bayesMotivatedReasoningClimate2021","collection-title":"Human Response to Climate Change: From Neurons to Collective Action","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2021.02.009","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"page":"27-35","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Motivated reasoning and climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154621000310","volume":"42"},

Further, we examine how the scientist’s solution position (information only, non-controversial, and controversial) affects the public’s perception of the scientist’s motivation for sharing information about specific issues (flu, marijuana, climate change, severe weather). Finally, we assess how perceived motivations mediate the relationship between solution position and credibility. Using data from a quota sample of American adults obtained by Qualtrics (n = 2,453), we found that in some conditions advocating for a solution positively predicted credibility, while in one condition, it negatively predicted scientist credibility. We also found that the influence of solution position on perceived credibility was mediated by several motivation perceptions; most notably through perception that the scientist was motivated to: (a) serve the public and (b) persuade the public.

Some skepticism of science may stem from the perceived association between science and atheism, as well as stereotypes of religious individuals as prosocial. Three studies examine how scientists’ religious affiliation (or lack thereof) influences perceptions of their warmth and trustworthiness among Christian participants. (Study 1 also includes atheist participants for comparison purposes.) Whereas atheist participants evaluate atheist scientists as more trustworthy than scientists from various religious groups (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim), Christian participants consistently evaluate atheist scientists as less trustworthy and less warm than religious scientists, and not exclusively Christian scientists. These effects are explained, in part, by Christian participants’ perceptions that atheist scientists are less motivated by prosociality compared to religiously affiliated scientists and, as Study 3 demonstrates, have a negative association with trust in scientists in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Beauchamp","given":"Alexandra L."},{"family":"Rios","given":"Kimberly"}],"citation-key":"beauchampSecularismScienceRole2020","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662519888599","ISSN":"0963-6625, 1361-6609","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"language":"en","page":"194-210","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Secularism in science: The role of religious affiliation in assessments of scientists’ trustworthiness","title-short":"Secularism in science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662519888599","volume":"29"},

This research aims to examine one group, Christians, and how their evaluations of scientists are influenced by both the scientist’s religiosity and the type of research the scientist conducts. Two pilot studies showed that Christians are less trusting of science focused on policy change (i.e. impact science) than of science focused on producing technology (i.e. production science), and that Christians distrust Atheist scientists more so than other religiously-identified scientists. Three studies further examined the relationship between religious affiliation and trustworthiness by exploring science type and information type (morality/competence) respectively as moderators, as well as potential mediators (e.g. perceived threat from science to religion, inferred scientists’ motives). Findings indicated a consistent main effect of religious affiliation on trustworthiness, an effect mediated by perceived benevolence motives. Specifically, Atheist scientists were found to be less trustworthy than any religiously affiliated group, due to the belief that Atheist scientists were less motivated to help humanity.","author":[{"family":"Beauchamp","given":"Alexandra L"}],"citation-key":"beauchampValueSciencePerceptions","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Value in Science: Perceptions of Religiosity Influence Trust of Scientists","type":"thesis"},

Based on goal-systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002, 2013), the present research found that expectancy of goal achievement positively predicts the perceived instrumentality of multifinal means, which compound value by fulfilling several goals simultaneously, and negatively predicts perceived instrumentality of counterfinal means, which afford greater expectancy of attaining a given goal, but are detrimental to alternative goals. Study 1 found correlational and Study 2 experimental evidence of this phenomenon. Study 3 evinced that expectancy of goal achievement was associated with the number of multifinal and counterfinal means generated for goal pursuit. Study 4 found that expectancy predicted whether people select to engage in multifinal (vs. counterfinal) means.

  {"id":"belangerMoreLessEffect2015","abstract":"Prior research in a multifinality context has demonstrated a dilution effect whereby the number of goals connected to a means is inversely connected to the perceived instrumentality of each means (Zhang, Fishbach, & Kruglanski, 2007). In the present research, six studies tested whether the dilution effect would also occur in an equifinality context where more than one means serves a single goal. The results corroborated this hypothesis. Presenting additional means (Study 1) and having participants self-generate multiple means (Study 2) led, as expected, to a reduction in perceived effectiveness of the means. The effect was stronger when the means within the set were seen as distinct rather than similar (Study 3). Increasing the strength of association between one means and the goal led to a reduction in the associative strength of the other means within the set and to a decrease of its perceived effectiveness (Study 4). The dilution effect was found to influence means selection and the magnitude of means engagement (Study 5). Lastly, presenting additional means to attain a goal reduced the perceived effectiveness of the means, which in turn reduced participants' intrinsic motivation to pursue it (Study 6). Overall, the present work demonstrates that the presence of alternative means to a goal reduces the quality and intensity of engagement in a given means. Broad implications of these findings are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bélanger","given":"Jocelyn J."},{"family":"Schori-Eyal","given":"Noa"},{"family":"Pica","given":"Gennaro"},{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."},{"family":"Lafrenière","given":"Marc-André"}],"citation-key":"belangerMoreLessEffect2015","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jesp.2015.05.005","ISSN":"0022-1031","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"93-102","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The “more is less” effect in equifinal structures: Alternative means reduce the intensity and quality of motivation","title-short":"The “more is less” effect in equifinal structures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000554","volume":"60"},

While this development has many benefits, scientists also face the challenge of devaluation and public criticism by laypersons. Embedding this phenomenon in social-psychological theories and research on value-behavior correspondence, we investigated moral threat as a factor influencing laypersons’ engagement with science. Across three studies, we hypothesized and found that moral values shape the way laypersons evaluate and communicate about science when these values are threatened in a given situation and central to people’s self-concept. However, prior research on the underlying mechanism of moral threat effects cannot fully rule out value salience as an alternative explanation. To close this gap, we situationally induced value salience while varying the degree of moral threat (Study 3). Our findings indicate that moral threat amplifies the influence of moral values on laypersons’ evaluation of science above and beyond value salience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Rothmund","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Nauroth","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Gollwitzer","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"benderHowMoralThreat2016","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","DOI":"10.1177/0146167216671518","ISSN":"0146-1672, 1552-7433","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1723-1735","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"Crossref","title":"How Moral Threat Shapes Laypersons’ Engagement with Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"impure","volume":"42"},

Epistemic beliefs are considered to be an individual's beliefs about the nature of truth and knowledge. The process model of epistemic belief change offered in this chapter contributes to the understanding of epistemological development in several important ways. The crux of the current model is a detailed view into experiences associated with epistemic doubt. Using descriptions of this experience from individual participants, a four-component model of epistemic belief change is offered to represent the experience as whole. The current model is a significant first step in exploring epistemic doubt and its contribution to epistemic change. The role of epistemic doubt as a mechanism of change is confirmed in the model. The affective side of epistemological development is also illuminated. One of the more unique and compelling findings of this study is the window that was provided into the tumultuous experience of doubting one's epistemic beliefs. An additional contribution of this study was a description of the various strategies employed by individuals to resolve their epistemic doubt successfully.

Despite a great deal of attention to attitudes towards experts in the context of such crises, one significant feature of public trust remains underexamined. When public policy claims to follow the science, citizens are asked not just to believe what they are told by experts, but to follow expert recommendations. I argue that this requires a more demanding form of trust, which I call recommendation trust. I argue for three claims about recommendation trust: recommendation trust is different from both epistemic and practical trust; the conditions for well-placed recommendation trust are more demanding than the conditions for well-placed epistemic trust; and many measures that have been proposed to cultivate trust in experts do not give the public good reasons to trust in expert-led policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"bennettShouldImTold2020","container-title":"Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal","container-title-short":"Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal","DOI":"10.1353/ken.2020.0014","ISSN":"1086-3249","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"243-263","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Should I Do as I’m Told?

Understanding the presumed motives of scientists and science can inform the social psychological underpinnings of public trust in science. Across five independent datasets, perceiving the motives of science and scientists as prosocial promoted public trust in science. In Studies 1 and 2, perceptions that science was more prosocially oriented were associated with greater trust in science. Studies 3 and 4a & 4b employed experimental methods to establish that perceiving other-oriented motives, versus self-oriented motives, enhanced public trust in science.

  {"id":"bentzenCrisisWePray2021","abstract":"In times of crisis, humans have a tendency to turn to religion for comfort and explanation. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Using daily and weekly data on Google searches for 107 countries, this research demonstrates that the COVID-19 crisis resulted in a massive rise in the intensity of prayer. During the early months of the pandemic, Google searches for prayer relative to all Google searches rose by 30%, reaching the highest level ever recorded. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that by April 1, 2020, more than half of the world population had prayed to end the coronavirus. Prayer searches remained 10% higher than previously throughout 2020, particularly so in Europe and the Americas. Prayer searches rose more among the more religious, rose on all continents, at all levels of income, inequality, and insecurity, and for all types of religion, except Buddhism. The increase is not merely a substitute for services in the physical churches that closed down to limit the spread of the virus. Instead, the rise is due to an intensified demand for religion: People pray to cope with adversity. The results thus reveal that religiosity has risen globally due to the pandemic with potential direct long-term consequences for various socio-economic outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bentzen","given":"Jeanet Sinding"}],"citation-key":"bentzenCrisisWePray2021","container-title":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.jebo.2021.10.014","ISSN":"0167-2681","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"541-583","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"In crisis, we pray: Religiosity and the COVID-19 pandemic","title-short":"In crisis, we pray","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268121004443","volume":"192"},
  {"id":"bentzenReligionGlobalCultural2024","abstract":"Abstract\n          As a cultural species, humans show marked global diversity in preferences, beliefs, and behaviors (cultural traits). Of the many types of cultural traits, which ones generate the most global diversity across countries? We address this question by analyzing data for 640,110 individuals from 117 countries, 2,333 sub-national districts worldwide, and 13 birth cohorts surveyed in the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS). We measure cultural diversity using the standard Cultural Fixation Index (CFst). Across multiple sets of comparable cultural traits, we find that religious cultural traits are globally most diverse. In personal values, the emphasis on religion differs 5-10 times more than the emphasis on family, politics, or work effort across countries. Similarly, in qualities important for raising children, religion showed the most cultural divergence. Diversity in religious membership is also significantly higher, compared to memberships in political, environmental or sports organizations. This global divergence had two distinct sources: it was partly the result of differences among particular religious groups, namely Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus; but in large part it was due to individual differences in the strength of religious engagement, irrespective of religious tradition. The results  reveal the  pervasive role of religion and secularization in the cultural evolution of societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bentzen","given":"Jeanet"},{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Anne Sofie"},{"family":"Sperling","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"}],"citation-key":"bentzenReligionGlobalCultural2024","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-5609419/v1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,23]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","publisher":"In Review","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Religion and global cultural diversity","type":"article","URL":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5609419/v1"},

Such an assumption is wrong. Examination of conflicts between science and religion (such as those about evolution) show that they always arise through misinterpretation or tenacious presuppositions. Unfortunately protagonists (both anti-religion and anti-science) receive more publicity than conciliators. This paper reviews some of the background and development of arguments over creation and evolution and shows that there is no need to choose between a rigorous scientific approach and an avowedly religious acknowledgement of God as creator and sustainer.","author":[{"family":"Berry","given":"R.

  {"id":"betancurSocioeconomicGapsScience2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In contrast to the extensive research on socioeconomic gaps in reading and math achievement, little attention has been given to socioeconomic disparities in science skills, particularly during the early years of schooling. This emphasis on later years may be problematic because large socioeconomic disparities emerge in the early years, thus it is crucial to document the size of disparities in science achievement and begin unpacking the range of factors that contribute to these disparities. Additionally, it is crucial to know which components of socioeconomic status are more strongly linked to children's science skills so that resources can be more effectively targeted to address disparities. Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (N = 9250), this study examines disparities in science achievement across elementary and middle school related to parental income and parental education separating their effects from each other and from a range of confounding factors. Additionally, it considers whether characteristics of children, families, and schools are pathways through which socioeconomic disparities emerge.\nRESULTS: Results show moderate gaps in science achievement related to both household income and parental education. The primary pathways through which parental education and family income influenced science achievement was through mathematics and reading achievement. For parental education gaps, smaller indirect effects also operated through access to informal science learning opportunities both inside and outside of the home environment.\nCONCLUSION: First, this study highlights the importance of considering the contributions of multiple measures of socioeconomic status, instead of a composite. Second, it shows that socioeconomic disparities in science achievement emerge early and that programs and policies aimed at addressing these gaps may need to target children during the early elementary and preschool years. Third, our findings suggest that elementary instructional approaches that simultaneously address science instruction with reading and/or mathematics instruction will likely be especially important for improving overall science outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Betancur","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Votruba-Drzal","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Schunn","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"betancurSocioeconomicGapsScience2018","container-title":"International journal of STEM education","container-title-short":"Int J STEM Educ","DOI":"10.1186/s40594-018-0132-5","ISSN":"2196-7822","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","page":"38","PMCID":"PMC6310441","PMID":"30631728","source":"PubMed","title":"Socioeconomic gaps in science achievement","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"betschConfidenceDevelopmentMeasure18","abstract":"Background Monitoring the reasons why a considerable number of people do not receive recommended vaccinations allows identification of important trends over time, and designing and evaluating strategies to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake. Existing validated measures assessing vaccine hesitancy focus primarily on confidence in vaccines and the system that delivers them. However, empirical and theoretical work has stated that complacency (not perceiving diseases as high risk), constraints (structural and psychological barriers), calculation (engagement in extensive information searching), and aspects pertaining to collective responsibility (willingness to protect others) also play a role in explaining vaccination behavior. The objective was therefore to develop a validated measure of these 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination. Methods and findings Three cross-sectional studies were conducted. Study 1 uses factor analysis to develop an initial scale and assesses the sub-scales’ convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity (N = 1,445, two German convenience-samples). In Study 2, a sample representative regarding age and gender for the German population (N = 1,003) completed the measure for vaccination in general and for specific vaccinations to assess the potential need for a vaccine-specific wording of items. Study 3 compared the novel scale’s performance with six existing measures of vaccine hesitancy (N = 350, US convenience-sample). As an outcome, a long (15-item) and short (5-item) 5C scale were developed as reliable and valid indicators of confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. The 5C sub-scales correlated with relevant psychological concepts, such as attitude (confidence), perceived personal health status and invulnerability (complacency), self-control (constraints), preference for deliberation (calculation), and communal orientation (collective responsibility), among others. The new scale provided similar results when formulated in a general vs. vaccine-specific way (Study 2). In a comparison of seven measures the 5C scale was constantly among the scales that explained the highest amounts of variance in analyses predicting single vaccinations (between 20% and 40%; Study 3). The present studies are limited to the concurrent validity of the scales. Conclusions The 5C scale provides a novel tool to monitor psychological antecedents of vaccination and facilitates diagnosis, intervention design and evaluation. Its short version is suitable for field settings and regular global monitoring of relevant antecedents of vaccination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Betsch","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Heinemeier","given":"Dorothee"},{"family":"Korn","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Holtmann","given":"Cindy"},{"family":"Böhm","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"betschConfidenceDevelopmentMeasure18","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0208601","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["18",12,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e0208601","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Beyond confidence: Development of a measure assessing the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination","title-short":"Beyond confidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208601","volume":"13"},

Results from statistical models show that two theodicic interpretations—believing that God: is using the pandemic as a way to tell humanity to change; and will personally protect you from the virus—significantly increased believers’ reports of faith strengthening, controlling for other factors.

  {"id":"bigliardiBarboursTypologiesContemporary2012","abstract":"Despite various criticisms, Ian Barbour's fourfold classification of the possible relationships between religion and science remains influential. I compare Barbour's taxonomy with the theories of four authors who, in the last four decades, have addressed the relationship between science and religion from a Muslim perspective. The aim of my analysis is twofold. First, I offer a comparative perspective to the debate on science and Islam. Second, following Barbour's suggestion, I test the general applicability of his categories by comparing them with a discourse on science and religion that is not focused on Christianity. In the first section, I reconstruct Barbour's typologies, recalling some major objections to them, and arguing why despite the latter, Barbour's model is employed for the present analysis. I also reconstruct Barbour's parallel model for the relationships between different religions. In the second section, I reconstruct the discourse on science and religion developed by the Palestinian-American scholar Ismail Raji al-Faruqi. The third section is devoted to the ideas of the Persian-American scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr. In the fourth section, I examine the views of the Iranian author Mehdi Golshani. The fifth section reconstructs the theories of the Algerian author Nidhal Guessoum. In the final section, I argue that a generalized use of the “integration” concept to refer to the entire debate on Islam and science is unhelpful. While these positions do not appear to instantiate Barbourian integration of science and religion, they do move toward what Barbour (skeptically) describes as integration between religions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bigliardi","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"bigliardiBarboursTypologiesContemporary2012","container-title":"Zygon®","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01269.x","ISSN":"1467-9744","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2012 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon","page":"501-519","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Barbour's Typologies and the Contemporary Debate on Islam and Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01269.x","volume":"47"},

However, recent research has brought attention to adaptive and functional aspects of conspiracy theories. This article presents a framework for understanding conspiracy beliefs as a paradoxical adaptation to historical trauma. There is vast evidence that three essential aspects of historical trauma (loss of personal and collective control, status devaluation, and victimhood) constitute the key antecedents of conspiracy beliefs. Although conspiracy theories might be adaptive in times of shared trauma (e.g., war, colonization), they become maladaptive in times of peace and prosperity. The popularity of conspiracy theories in historically traumatized societies threatens individuals’ health and well-being, social trust, cohesiveness, and intergroup harmony.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bilewicz","given":"Michał"}],"citation-key":"bilewiczConspiracyBeliefsAdaptation2022","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2022.101359","ISSN":"2352250X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","page":"101359","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conspiracy beliefs as an adaptation to historical trauma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352250X22000781","volume":"47"},

These findings expand upon previous research in a number of ways, most importantly by showing that (a) children spontaneously keep track of an individual’s history and use it to guide subsequent learning without any prompting, and (b) children’s sensitivity to others’ prior accuracy is not specific to the domain of language.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Birch","given":"Susan A.

We challenge the popular view that science and religion are compatible, a view that suggests that learning and understanding evolutionary theory has no effect on students’ religious beliefs and vice versa. We develop a cognitive perspective on how students manage to reconcile evolutionary theory with their religious beliefs. We underwrite the claim developed by cognitive scientists and anthropologists that religion is natural because it taps into people’s intuitive understanding of the natural world which is constrained by essentialist, teleological and intentional biases. After contrasting the naturalness of religion with the unnaturalness of science, we discuss the difficulties cognitive and developmental scientists have identified in learning and accepting evolutionary theory. We indicate how religious beliefs impede students’ understanding and acceptance of evolutionary theory. We explore a number of options available to students for reconciling an informed understanding of evolutionary theory with their religious beliefs. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our account for science and biology teachers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Blancke","given":"Stefaan"},{"family":"De Smedt","given":"Johan"},{"family":"De Cruz","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Boudry","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Braeckman","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"blanckeImplicationsCognitiveSciences2012","container-title":"Science & Education","container-title-short":"Sci & Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11191-011-9402-z","ISSN":"1573-1901","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1167-1184","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Implications of the Cognitive Sciences for the Relation Between Religion and Science Education: The Case of Evolutionary Theory","title-short":"The Implications of the Cognitive Sciences for the Relation Between Religion and Science Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-011-9402-z","volume":"21"},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that cognitive dissonance leading to an emotional response is a barrier to learning about and accepting evolution. We explored the hypothesis that students whose worldviews may be inconsistent with the acceptance of evolution generate detectable emotional responses in the form of physiological changes when exposed to evolutionary themes. Physiological data (respiratory rate, galvanic skin response, and heart rate) were collected from participants while they were asked “yes/no” questions, some of which referenced evolution. Questions were of three categories: relevant, irrelevant, and control. Authenticity of response rates to relevant questions such as “Do you believe in evolution?” were verified using visual inspection to compare degree of response rates with control questions, such as “Have you ever cheated on a test?” Our results support our hypothesis. Of the 33 participants included in our study, a majority of them produced detectable physiological changes indicating emotional responses when asked questions referencing evolution. The highest response rate (79%) was generated by the question “Do you believe in evolution?” The implications of an emotional response in students when presented with instruction in evolutionary theory are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bland","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"blandExperimentalDetectionEmotional2015","container-title":"The American Biology Teacher","container-title-short":"The American Biology Teacher","DOI":"10.1525/abt.2015.77.6.413","ISSN":"0002-7685","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"413-420","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"The Experimental Detection of an Emotional Response to the Idea of Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/abt/article/77/6/413/18765/The-Experimental-Detection-of-an-Emotional","volume":"77"},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Boateng","given":"Godfred O."},{"family":"Neilands","given":"Torsten B."},{"family":"Frongillo","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Melgar-Quiñonez","given":"Hugo R."},{"family":"Young","given":"Sera L."}],"citation-key":"boatengBestPracticesDeveloping2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Public Health","DOI":"10/gfsqzs","ISSN":"2296-2565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Best Practices for Developing and Validating Scales for Health, Social, and Behavioral Research: A Primer","title-short":"Best Practices for Developing and Validating Scales for Health, Social, and Behavioral Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00149","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"bohmBehaviouralConsequencesVaccination2017","abstract":"Summary Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent seasonal influenza. However, globally, the recommendations vary from country to country, ranging from universal recommendations, risk-group-specific recommendations, to no recommendation at all. Due to high diversity both in recommendation practice and country-specific preconditions, it is difficult to determine the effect of different recommendations on vaccine uptake. This incentivised laboratory experiment (N = 288) tests the behavioural consequences of different recommendations in a repeated interactive vaccination game. The participants are part of heterogeneous groups, comprised of low- and high-risk type of players. They receive either a universal, risk-group-specific or no recommendation prior to their vaccination decisions. Results show that individuals are sensitive to the recommendations. In detail, a risk-group-specific recommendation increases vaccine uptake of high-risk types. However, at the same time, it decreases vaccine uptake of low-risk types. The results imply that when the proportion of low-risk types in a population is considerably larger than the high-risk group, a risk-group-specific (vs. universal) recommendation comes at the cost of decreased social benefit of vaccination due to the overall lower vaccine uptake. Policy decision-making should therefore complement epidemiological considerations with potential positive and negative behavioural consequences of vaccination recommendations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Böhm","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Nicolas W."},{"family":"Korn","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Betsch","given":"Cornelia"}],"citation-key":"bohmBehaviouralConsequencesVaccination2017","container-title":"Health Economics","container-title-short":"Health Economics","DOI":"10.1002/hec.3584","ISSN":"1057-9230","issue":"S3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"page":"66-75","source":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Behavioural consequences of vaccination recommendations: An experimental analysis","title-short":"Behavioural consequences of vaccination recommendations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hec.3584","volume":"26"},

Vaccinating can therefore be interpreted as a prosocial act. However, HCP vaccination rates are often far too low to prevent nosocomial infections. Effective interventions are needed to increase HCP’s influenza vaccine uptake. Here we devise a novel tool to experimentally test interventions that aim at increasing prosocially motivated vaccine uptake under controlled conditions. We conducted a large-scale and cross-cultural experiment with participants from countries with either a collectivistic (South Korea) or an individualistic (USA) cultural background. Results showed that prosocially motivated vaccination was more likely in South Korea compared to the US, mediated by a greater perception of vaccination as a social act. However, changing the default of vaccination, such that participants had to opt out rather than to opt in, increased vaccine uptake in the US and therefore compensated for the lower level of prosocial vaccination. In sum, the present study provides both a novel method to investigate HCP influenza vaccination behavior and interventions to increase their vaccine uptake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Böhm","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Betsch","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Korn","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Holtmann","given":"Cindy"}],"citation-key":"bohmExploringPromotingProsocial2016","container-title":"BioMed Research International","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/6870984","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","title":"Exploring and Promoting Prosocial Vaccination: A Cross-Cultural Experiment on Vaccination of Health Care Personnel","title-short":"Exploring and Promoting Prosocial Vaccination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/6870984/"},

Yet past studies have often overlooked religion as a key explanatory factor shaping racial-ethnic differences in perceptions of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. The authors examine whether views of the relationship between religion and science shape agreement with different explanations for mental health conditions. Drawing on a national probability survey collected in 2021 (n = 3,390), the authors find that individuals who draw boundaries between religion and science had higher odds of rejecting biological and social explanations of mental health conditions, whereas individuals who see religion and science as collaborative had higher odds of affirming biological and social explanations. Belief that we trust science too much (and religion not enough) helped explain Black respondents’ support for religious explanations.

  {"id":"boteroEcologyReligiousBeliefs2014","abstract":"Although ecological forces are known to shape the expression of sociality across a broad range of biological taxa, their role in shaping human behavior is currently disputed. Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Botero","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Beth"},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Kathryn R."},{"family":"Bulbulia","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Gavin","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Gray","given":"Russell D."}],"citation-key":"boteroEcologyReligiousBeliefs2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1408701111","ISBN":"9781408701119","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"47","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,25]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

We argue that this is in fact due to Michael Behe's own incoherent definition and use of IC. This paper offers an analysis of several equivocations inherent in the concept of Irreducible Complexity and discusses the way in which advocates of the Intelligent Design Creationism (IDC) have conveniently turned IC into a moving target.

Patriarchal norms that place men as the head of household are often to blame. Previous research suggests that trusted authorities can shift perceptions of norms and create behavior change. In many settings, a compelling authority on behavior in relationships is religious leaders, who are influential sources of information about proper conduct in relationships and gatekeepers of marriage, but may also uphold traditional gender roles. One way leaders exert their influence is through premarital or couples counseling courses. In this study, we test whether, if given an opportunity to offer a more progressive religious interpretation of gender roles during these courses, religious leaders could motivate men to share power and thereby reduce violence. Building on existing faith networks of Christian religious leaders in western Uganda, we conducted a large pair-matched, randomized controlled trial among 1,680 heterosexual couples in which participants were randomized to attend a 12-session group counseling course or wait-listed. We find that the program shifted power from men to women and reduced intimate partner violence by five percentage points, comparable with more intensive secular programs. These improvements were largest among couples counseled by religious leaders who held the most progressive views at baseline and who critically engaged with the material. Our findings suggest that religious leaders can be effective agents of change for reducing violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyer","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Levy Paluck","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Annan","given":"Jeannie"},{"family":"Nevatia","given":"Tvisha"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Jasper"},{"family":"Namubiru","given":"Jackline"},{"family":"Heise","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Lehrer","given":"Rachel"}],"citation-key":"boyerReligiousLeadersCan2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2200262119","issue":"31","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e2200262119","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de (Atypon)","title":"Religious leaders can motivate men to cede power and reduce intimate partner violence: experimental evidence from Uganda","title-short":"Religious leaders can motivate men to cede power and reduce intimate partner violence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2200262119","volume":"119"},

However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Brady","given":"William J."},{"family":"Wills","given":"Julian A."},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Bavel","given":"Jay J.

  {"id":"brandtRolePrejudiceNeed2010","abstract":"Religious fundamentalism has been consistently linked to prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. This article proposes that this is partially the case because fundamentalist ideology provides a sense of consistency and closure. Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that fundamentalism provides are rejected in an effort to protect this certainty. Results from two studies, including one using a nationally representative sample, found that the need for closure was related to fundamentalism and partially mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and the derogation of lesbians and gays (Study 1) and value violators in general (Study 2). Furthermore, in Study 2, it was found that only some aspects of the need for closure explain the fundamentalism—prejudice relationship. Results are discussed in relation to past need for closure and ideology research as well as what this means for the study of fundamentalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Brandt","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Reyna","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"brandtRolePrejudiceNeed2010","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Bull","DOI":"10/c9svv9","ISSN":"0146-1672","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"715-725","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Role of Prejudice and the Need for Closure in Religious Fundamentalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167210366306","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"brohmerFacetsTrustScience2024","abstract":"The public perception of science and scientists themselves has become a much-debated topic in recent years. In this article, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the public’s trust in science by focussing on the practices of science, which are often not known by the public. Building on previous research by Ebersole, Axt and Nosek (2016), we conducted a preregistered, quota-sampled survey in Austria (N = 564), where we presented participants with different scenarios about scientific practices. Thereby, we disentangled the perception of scientists–i.e., how competent and ethical they are being perceived–from the confidence in their scientific findings–i.e., how correct their results are being perceived. For instance, when “a researcher X conducted a study with an interesting finding, which he then publishes”, this researcher was–in our study– perceived as averagely competent and ethical, and the findings were perceived as neither correct nor incorrect (but somewhere in between). However, if “another researcher Y tried to replicate X’s finding, but failed - and X then criticized Y’s methodology and dismissed the new study”, researcher X was perceived as less competent, less ethical and the original results were perceived as less correct by participants. Importantly, if researcher X “acknowledges Y’s methodology” or “investigates the difference between the original study and the failed replication”, ratings for X’s competence and ethical behavior were higher than for how correct his results were being perceived. Moreover, the highest competence and ethics ratings were obtained, when researcher X was described to share the methods and data online for transparency. Psychological dispositions of the participants, such as political orientation or motivation for cognition, did not seem to affect these ratings to a large degree. These results are discussed in the light of Mertonian norms of science, which highlight cooperativeness and disinterestedness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Brohmer","given":"Hilmar"},{"family":"Ceh","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Czerwonka","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Grinschgl","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Hofer","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Lebuda","given":"Izabela"},{"family":"Walter","given":"Hildrun"}],"citation-key":"brohmerFacetsTrustScience2024","container-title":"Meta-Psychology","DOI":"10.15626/MP.2024.4230","ISSN":"2003-2714","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,20]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2024 Hilmar Brohmer, Simon Ceh, Marta Czerwonka, Sandra Grinschgl, Gabriela Hofer, Izabela Lebuda, Hildrun Walter","source":"open.lnu.se","title":"Facets of Trust in Science: Researchers can be perceived as ethical and competent despite inconsistent research results","title-short":"Facets of Trust in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/4230","volume":"8"},

Recently, one such potentially important driving factor has emerged, the COVID-19 pandemic. Have trust in science and other science-related beliefs changed in Germany from before to during the pandemic? To investigate this, we re-analyzed data from a set of representative surveys conducted in April, May, and November 2020, which were obtained as part of the German survey Science Barometer, and compared it to data from the last annual Science Barometer survey that took place before the pandemic, (in September 2019). Results indicate that German’s trust in science increased substantially after the pandemic began and slightly declined in the months thereafter, still being higher in November 2020 than in September 2019. Moreover, trust was closely related to expectations about how politics should handle the pandemic. We also find that increases of trust were most pronounced among the higher-educated. But as the pandemic unfolded, decreases of trust were more likely among supporters of the populist right-wing party AfD. We discuss the sustainability of these dynamics as well as implications for science communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Mede","given":"Niels G."},{"family":"Thomm","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Kremer","given":"Bastian"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Ricarda"}],"citation-key":"brommeAnchorTroubledTimes2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0262823","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"language":"en","page":"e0262823","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"An anchor in troubled times: Trust in science before and within the COVID-19 pandemic","title-short":"An anchor in troubled times","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0262823","volume":"17"},

Participants judged the pertinence of experts from diverse disciplines based on the experts' assumed contributions to texts adapted from original articles from Science and Nature. Subjective pertinence judgments were calibrated by comparing them with bibliometrics of the original articles. Furthermore, participants' general science knowledge was controlled.

  {"id":"brommeKnowledgeEpistemologicalBeliefs2008","abstract":"Recent research points to the centrality of epistemological knowledge in subject-matter learning and reasoning. However, our understanding of factors that might influence epistemological development is still fairly limited. In this chapter, we synthesize results from a series of cross-sectional studies in order to consider sociocultural perspectives of epistemological development, and the role that schooling, community, and culture play in this process. An overall sample of 390 Israeli adolescents completed an epistemological reasoning questionnaire, adapted from Kuhn et al. (2000), which assesses whether respondents hold absolutist, multiplist, or evaluativist positions concerning the truth-value of knowledge claims in values, social, and physical domains. Participants included secular Jewish 7th, 9th, and 11th graders, religious Jewish 7th graders, and Bedouin 7th and 9th graders. Thus, we were able to compare differences in epistemological positions across grade-level and cultural background. There were similar gradelevel differences in both groups, but the Bedouins had higher percentages of absolutists than the Jews in all domains, particularly in values. Grade-level changes across cultural groups suggest that schooling is a factor in changes in epistemological understanding. However, cultural differences suggest that cultural values and out-of-school interactions might also be a factor in epistemological understanding. Sociocultural theory provides a framework that can explain patterns that diverge from typical developmental models, and existing literature on the epistemological beliefs of particular cultural groups. The results might help explain why it has been difficult to find consistent age-related epistemological development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Kienhues","given":"Dorothe"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Elmar"}],"citation-key":"brommeKnowledgeEpistemologicalBeliefs2008","container-title":"Knowing, Knowledge and Beliefs: Epistemological Studies across Diverse Cultures","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4020-6596-5_8","editor":[{"family":"Khine","given":"Myint Swe"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-1-4020-6596-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"423-441","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Knowledge and Epistemological Beliefs: An Intimate but Complicate Relationship","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-6596-5_8"},

The most common friendship networks were described as bonds with co‐nationals, and yet all students attested to an increase in their cultural learning and mindfulness by the end of the sojourn. Nevertheless, intercultural competence was maximised only in those few students who pursued a multicultural strategy of interaction, leading the researcher to call on higher education institutions to instigate policies to encourage lasting cross‐cultural contact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Lorraine"}],"citation-key":"brownInternationalEducationForce2009","container-title":"Journal of Peace Education","DOI":"10.1080/17400200903086672","ISSN":"1740-0201","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,1]]},"page":"209-224","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"International education: a force for peace and cross‐cultural understanding?","title-short":"International education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17400200903086672","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013","abstract":"Conspiracy theories are ubiquitous when it comes to explaining political events and societal phenomena. Individuals differ not only in the degree to which they believe in specific conspiracy theories, but also in their general susceptibility to explanations based on such theories, that is, their conspiracy mentality. We present the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), an instrument designed to efficiently assess differences in the generic tendency to engage in conspiracist ideation within and across cultures. The CMQ is available in English, German, and Turkish. In four studies, we examined the CMQ’s factorial structure, reliability, measurement equivalence across cultures, and its convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. Analyses based on a cross-cultural sample (Study 1a; N = 7,766) supported the conceptualization of conspiracy mentality as a one-dimensional construct across the three language versions of the CMQ that is stable across time (Study 1b; N = 141). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the CMQ items. The instrument could therefore be used to examine differences in conspiracy mentality between European, North American, and Middle Eastern cultures. In Studies 2–4 (total N = 476), we report (re-)analyses of three datasets demonstrating the validity of the CMQ in student and working population samples in the UK and Germany. First, attesting to its convergent validity, the CMQ was highly correlated with another measure of generic conspiracy belief. Second, the CMQ showed patterns of meaningful associations with personality measures (e.g., Big Five dimensions, schizotypy), other generalized political attitudes (e.g., social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism), and further individual differences (e.g., paranormal belief, lack of socio-political control). Finally, the CMQ predicted beliefs in specific conspiracy theories over and above other individual difference measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruder","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Haffke","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Neave","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Nouripanah","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Imhoff","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00225","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Measuring Individual Differences in Generic Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories Across Cultures: Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire","title-short":"Measuring Individual Differences in Generic Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories Across Cultures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00225","volume":"4"},

Yet compliance with shelter-in-place policies issued by local and regional governments in the United States was uneven and may have been influenced by science skepticism and attitudes towards topics of scientific consensus. Using county–day measures of physical distancing derived from cell phone location data, we demonstrate that the proportion of people who stayed at home after shelter-in-place policies went into effect in March and April 2020 in the United States was significantly lower in counties with a high concentration of science skeptics. These results are robust to controlling for other potential drivers of differential physical distancing, such as political partisanship, income, education and COVID severity.

  {"id":"bucchiStyleScienceCommunication2013","abstract":"There is little doubt that during the past few decades science communication efforts aimed at non-expert audiences have increased in quantity and intensity on a global scale. Public engagement and outreach activities have now become a routine – when not a prominent – feature for several research institutions in Europe. However, it would be difficult for both scholars and those involved in science communication to agree on the impact of these activities, on the long-term implications of the ‘science communication movement’ and on the indicators we should develop and employ in order to assess impact. The paper argues that quality is a relevant issue and challenge for contemporary science communication. Style is relevant to addressing that challenge, insofar as it relates to discussions about how to strengthen the quality of science communication, suggesting a different perspective other than the traditional normative/prescriptive framework. The notion of style also fruitfully connects the debate on science communication with a rich tradition of studies in the history and sociology of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bucchi","given":"Massimiano"}],"citation-key":"bucchiStyleScienceCommunication2013","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662513498202","ISSN":"0963-6625, 1361-6609","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11]]},"language":"en","page":"904-915","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Style in science communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662513498202","volume":"22"},

Given the prominence of the multidimensional conceptualization of epistemic beliefs, it is important to examine the multidimensional measures of beliefs more closely. An examination of literature reveals that although many studies have been conducted with the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire or related measures, there are variations with regard to the number of identified factors and the nature of the beliefs those factors are meant to represent. Further, additional knowledge dimensions have been proposed and new measures of multidimensional beliefs have been developed. Although some variations are to be expected due to the measures used, age of the participants sampled, and the forms of analyses employed, the role of students’ cultural background must also be considered. In this chapter, I discuss the psychometric properties of the existing measures as well as how the factors that have been identified vary depending on the characteristics of participants and the analyses conducted.

In Study II, the modified instrument, the Domain-Specific Beliefs Questionnaire (DSBQ), was administered to 633 students and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. A subsample of participants' responses on the DSBQ was also compared to responses on Schommer's epistemological questionnaire. Study III involved a second confirmatory factor analysis using data from a new sample (n = 523). Those data were examined for potential gender differences. Overall, the results of this investigation suggested that students possess certain domain-specific beliefs about knowledge in mathematics and history.

  {"id":"buschCoexistenceNaturalSupernatural2017","abstract":"People across highly diverse cultural contexts use both natural and supernatural explanations to explain questions of fundamental concern such as death, illness, and human origins. The present study examines the development of explanatory coexistence within and across domains of existential concern in individuals in Tanna, Vanuatu. We examined three age groups: 7- to 12-year-old children, 13- to 18-year-old adolescents, and 19- to 70-year-old adults (N = 72). Within the domain of death, biological and spontaneous explanations were most common across all ages. For illness, children showed the highest rates of explanatory coexistence, while adolescents and adults favoured biological explanations. Within the human origins domain, theistic explanations were most common across the age groups. Overall, these data show that coexistence reasoning in these domains is pervasive across cultures, yet at the same time it is deeply contextually specific, reflecting the nuanced differences in local ecologies and cultural beliefs. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Individuals across highly diverse cultural contexts use both natural and supernatural explanations to understand the events that occur in their lives. Context and cultural input play a large role in determining when and how individuals incorporate natural and supernatural explanations. The development of explanatory coexistence has primarily studied explanations for isolated domains. What does this study add? We examined explanatory coexistence in a culture with recent conversion to Christianity and formal education. The current research examines how individuals reason within and across the domains of human origins, illness, and death. Developmental differences associated with explanatory coexistence are examined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Busch","given":"Justin T.

We studied whether or not spirituality/religiosity is a relevant resource for patients with chronic pain conditions, and to analyze interrelations between spirituality/religiosity (SpREUK Questionnaire; SpREUK is an acronym of the German translation of “Spiritual and Religious Attitudes in Dealing with Illness”), adaptive coping styles that refer to the concept of locus of disease control (AKU Questionnaire; AKU is an acronym of the German translation of “Adaptive Coping with Disease”), life satisfaction, and appraisal dimensions.Patients. In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 580 patients with chronic pain conditions were enrolled.Results. We found that the patients relied on both external powerful sources of disease control and on internal powers and virtues, while Trust in Higher Source (intrinsic religiosity) or Illness as Chance (reappraisal) were valued moderately; Search for Meaningful Support/Access (spiritual quest orientation) was of minor relevance. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that the internal sources of disease control, such as Conscious and Healthy Way of Living and Positive Attitudes, were (apart from the religious denomination) the strongest predictors of patients' reliance on spirituality/religiosity. Both behavioral styles were rated significantly lower in patients who regarded themselves as neither religious nor spiritual. Positive disease interpretations such as Challenge and Value were clearly associated with a spiritual quest orientation and intrinsic religiosity.Conclusion. The associations between spirituality/religiosity, positive appraisals. and internal adaptive coping strategies indicate that the utilization of spirituality/religiosity goes far beyond fatalistic acceptance, but can be regarded as an active coping process. The findings support the need for further research concerning the contributions of spiritual coping in adjustment to chronic pain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Büssing","given":"Arndt"},{"family":"Michalsen","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Balzat","given":"Hans-Joachim"},{"family":"Grünther","given":"Ralf-Achim"},{"family":"Ostermann","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Neugebauer","given":"Edmund A.

  {"id":"byrdAnalyticAtheismAnalytic2025","abstract":"Reflective thinking often predicts less belief in God or less religiosity – so-called analytic atheism. However, those correlations involve limitations: widely used tests of reflection confound reflection with ancillary abilities such as numeracy; some studies do not detect analytic atheism in every country; experimentally encouraging reflection makes some non-believers more open to believing in God; and one of the most common online research participant pools seems to produce lower data quality. So analytic atheism may be less than universal or partially explained by confounding factors. To test this, we developed better measures, controlled for more confounds, and employed more recruitment methods. All four studies detected signs of analytic atheism above and beyond confounds (N > 70,000 people from five of six continental regions). We also discovered analytic apostasy: the better a person performed on reflection tests, the greater their odds of losing their religion since childhood – even when controlling for confounds. Analytic apostasy even seemed to explain analytic atheism: apostates were more reflective than others and analytic atheism was undetected after excluding apostates. Religious conversion was rare and unrelated to reflection, suggesting reflection’s relationships to conversion and deconversion are asymmetric. Detected relationships were usually small, indicating reflective thinking is a reliable albeit marginal predictor of apostasy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Byrd","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Stich","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Sytsma","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"byrdAnalyticAtheismAnalytic2025","container-title":"Religious Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0034412525000198","ISSN":"0034-4125, 1469-901X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-25","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Analytic atheism and analytic apostasy across cultures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/religious-studies/article/analytic-atheism-and-analytic-apostasy-across-cultures/D5D0A95E8467CC17F29F9B539C1339C2"},

Anti-reflectivists deny that reflection delivers what reflectivists seek. Alas, the evidence is mixed. So, does reflection confer normative value or not? This paper argues for a middle way: reflection can confer normative value, but its ability to do this is bound by factors such as what we might call epistemic identity: an identity that involves particular beliefs—for example, religious and political identities. We may reflectively defend our identities’ beliefs rather than reflect open-mindedly to adopt whatever beliefs cohere with the best arguments and evidence. This bounded reflectivism is explicated with an algorithmic model of reflection synthesized from philosophy and science that yields testable predictions, psychometric implications, and realistic metaphilosophical suggestions—for example, overcoming motivated reflection may require embracing epistemic identity rather than veiling it (à la Rawls 1971).

  {"id":"cacciatoreOpposingEndsSpectrum2018","abstract":"Given the ethical questions that surround emerging science, this study is interested in studying public trust in scientific and religious authorities for information about the risks and benefits of science. Using data from a nationally representative survey of American adults, we employ regression analysis to better understand the relationships between several variables—including values, knowledge, and media attention—and trust in religious organizations and scientific institutions. We found that Evangelical Christians are generally more trusting of religious authority figures to tell the truth about the risks and benefits of science and technology, and only slightly less likely than non-Evangelicals to trust scientific authorities for the same information. We also found that many Evangelicals use mediated information and science knowledge differently than nonEvangelicals, with both increased knowledge and attention to scientific media having positive impacts on trust in scientific authorities among the latter, but not the former group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cacciatore","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Browning","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Scheufele","given":"Dietram A."},{"family":"Brossard","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Xenos","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Corley","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"cacciatoreOpposingEndsSpectrum2018","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","DOI":"10.1177/0963662516661090","ISSN":"0963-6625, 1361-6609","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","page":"11-28","source":"Crossref","title":"Opposing ends of the spectrum: Exploring trust in scientific and religious authorities","title-short":"Opposing ends of the spectrum","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662516661090","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"callaghanParentPsychologyDecision2019","abstract":"Objective\nThe study of vaccine hesitancy identifies parental decisions to delay childhood vaccinations as an important public health issue, with consequences for immunization rates, the pursuit of nonmedical exemptions in states, and disease outbreaks. While prior work has explored the demographic and social underpinnings of parental decisions to delay childhood vaccinations, little is known about how the psychological dispositions of parents are associated with this choice. We analyze public opinion data to assess the role of psychological factors in reported parental decisions to delay childhood vaccination.\nRationale\nWe anticipate that parents with certain psychological characteristics will be more likely to delay childhood vaccination. Specifically, we explore the roles of conspiratorial thinking, dispositions towards needle sensitivity, and moral purity; expecting that parents with high levels of any of these characteristics will be more likely to delay vaccinating their children.\nMethod\nIn an original survey of 4010 American parents weighted to population benchmarks, we asked parents about delay-related vaccination behavior, demographic questions, and several psychological batteries. We then developed a vaccination delay scale and modeled delay as a function of conspiratorial thinking, needle sensitivity, moral purity, and relevant demographic controls. We then re-specified our models to look specifically at the predictors of delaying HPV vaccination, which has a low uptake rate in the United States.\nResults\nControlling for other common predictors of hesitant behavior, we find that parents with high levels of conspiratorial thinking and needle sensitivity are more likely to report pursuing alternative vaccination schedules. When analyzing the specific decision by parents to delay HPV vaccination, we find that tendencies towards moral purity and, in turn, sexual deviance are also associated with vaccine seeking behavior.\nConclusion\nParental decisions to delay childhood vaccinations are an important public health concern that are associated with conspiratorial thinking and needle sensitivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Callaghan","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Motta","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Sylvester","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Lunz Trujillo","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Blackburn","given":"Christine Crudo"}],"citation-key":"callaghanParentPsychologyDecision2019","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10/ghqkgs","ISSN":"0277-9536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"112407","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Parent psychology and the decision to delay childhood vaccination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619303934","volume":"238"},

This chapter describes a body of work showing that immanent justice reasoning is (a) motivated, in part, by the need to construe outcomes as deserved; (b) driven by intuitive more than controlled mental processes; and (c) more openly expressed among individuals who believe in supernatural phenomena. This review also documents several additional lines of inquiry exploring key assumptions about the nature, origins, and functions of immanent justice reasoning, including immanent justice reasoning for self-relevant fortuitous outcomes, the social-communicative function of immanent justice reasoning, and the interplay between immanent justice and normative causal reasoning. Early research portrayed immanent justice reasoning as unique to children, but this chapter identifies several conditions under which it is predictably displayed by adults. Immanent justice reasoning serves important psychological functions in adulthood, and is underpinned by reasoning processes and metaphysical assumptions that are not put away when children become adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Callan","given":"Mitchell J."},{"family":"Sutton","given":"Robbie M."},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Annelie J."},{"family":"Dawtry","given":"Rael J."}],"citation-key":"callanImmanentJusticeReasoning2014","container-title":"Advances in Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-800052-6.00002-0","ISBN":"978-0-12-800052-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"105-161","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immanent Justice Reasoning","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128000526000020","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"caluoriConflictChangesHow2020","abstract":"Religion shapes the nature of intergroup conflict, but conflict may also shape religion. Here, we report four multimethod studies that reveal the impact of conflict on religious belief: The threat of warfare and intergroup tensions increase the psychological need for order and obedience to rules, which leads people to view God as more punitive. Studies 1 (N = 372) and 2 (N = 911) showed that people’s concern about conflict correlates with belief in a punitive God. Study 3 (N = 1,065) found that experimentally increasing the salience of conflict increases people’s perceptions of the importance of a punitive God, and this effect is mediated by people’s support for a tightly regulated society. Study 4 showed that the severity of warfare predicted and preceded worldwide fluctuations in punitive-God belief between 1800 CE and 2000 CE. Our findings illustrate how conflict can change the nature of religious belief and add to a growing literature showing how cultural ecologies shape psychology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Caluori","given":"Nava"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Joshua Conrad"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Michele"}],"citation-key":"caluoriConflictChangesHow2020","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797619895286","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","page":"280-292","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conflict Changes How People View God","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619895286","volume":"31"},

Politics is also shaping many Americans' religious views. There has been a stunning change in the percentage of religious believers who, prior to Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, overwhelmingly objected to immoral private behavior by politicians but now dismiss it as irrelevant to their ability to act ethically in their public role.

Using multiwave panel and experimental data, we find that religious and secular orientations are endogenous to political orientations. In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way—not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations.

  {"id":"carloneUnderstandingScienceExperiences2007","abstract":"In this study, we develop a model of science identity to make sense of the science experiences of 15 successful women of color over the course of their undergraduate and graduate studies in science and into science-related careers. In our view, science identity accounts both for how women make meaning of science experiences and how society structures possible meanings. Primary data included ethnographic interviews during students' undergraduate careers, follow-up interviews 6 years later, and ongoing member-checking. Our results highlight the importance of recognition by others for women in the three science identity trajectories: research scientist; altruistic scientist; and disrupted scientist. The women with research scientist identities were passionate about science and recognized themselves and were recognized by science faculty as science people. The women with altruistic scientist identities regarded science as a vehicle for altruism and created innovative meanings of “science,” “recognition by others,” and “woman of color in science.” The women with disrupted scientist identities sought, but did not often receive, recognition by meaningful scientific others. Although they were ultimately successful, their trajectories were more difficult because, in part, their bids for recognition were disrupted by the interaction with gendered, ethnic, and racial factors. This study clarifies theoretical conceptions of science identity, promotes a rethinking of recruitment and retention efforts, and illuminates various ways women of color experience, make meaning of, and negotiate the culture of science. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  {"id":"carrierValuesObjectivityScience2013","abstract":"My intention is to cast light on the characteristics of epistemic or fundamental research (in contrast to application-oriented research). I contrast a Baconian notion of objectivity, expressing a correspondence of the views of scientists to the facts, with a pluralist notion, involving a critical debate between conflicting approaches. These conflicts include substantive hypotheses or theories but extend to values as well. I claim that a plurality of epistemic values serves to accomplish a non-Baconian form of objectivity that is apt to preserve most of the intuitions tied to the objectivity of science. For instance, pluralism is the only way to cope with the challenge of preference bias. Furthermore, the plurality of epistemic values cannot be substantially reduced by exploring the empirical success of scientific theories distinguished in light of particular such values. However, in addition to pluralism at the level of theories and value-commitments alike, scientific research is also characterized by a joint striving for consensus which I trace back to a shared epistemic attitude. This attitude manifests itself, e.g., in the willingness of scientists to subject their claims to empirical scrutiny and to respect rational argument. This shared epistemic attitude is embodied in rules adopted by the scientific community concerning general principles of dealing with knowledge claims. My contention is that pluralism and consensus formation can be brought into harmony by placing them at different levels of consideration: at the level of scientific reasoning and at the level of social conventions regarding how to deal with claims put forward within the scientific community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Carrier","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"carrierValuesObjectivityScience2013","container-title":"Science & Education","container-title-short":"Sci & Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11191-012-9481-5","ISSN":"1573-1901","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2547-2568","source":"Springer Link","title":"Values and Objectivity in Science: Value-Ladenness, Pluralism and the Epistemic Attitude","title-short":"Values and Objectivity in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-012-9481-5","volume":"22"},

Effective or adaptive epistemic cognition underlies the higher-order thinking required for life in the 21st century and has been positively correlated with academic achievement. As such, researchers have designed a number of educational interventions with the goal of developing students’ epistemic cognition, but no comprehensive examination of their efficacy exists. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to better understand the effect of epistemic cognition interventions upon academic achievement and what characteristics differentiated their efficacy. Twenty-six experimental and quasi-experimental studies met our inclusion criteria. Using 28 independent samples and 59 effect sizes, we found epistemic cognition interventions had a statistically significant, medium-level effect on academic achievement (Cohen’s d = 0.509, p < .001). Moderator analyses revealed interventions based in guided forms of instruction and models emphasizing justification and reconciliation of objectivity and subjectivity were more successful than other interventions, suggesting several promising directions for future research and practice. Surprisingly, we found that shorter interventions were generally more successful in promoting academic performance than longer ones.

  {"id":"casaraImpactEconomicInequality2022","abstract":"Previous literature highlights the crucial role of economic inequality in triggering a range of negative societal outcomes. However, the relationship between economic inequality and the proliferation of conspiracy beliefs remains unexplored. Here, we explore the endorsement of conspiracy beliefs as an outcome of objective countrylevel (Study 1a, 1b, 1c), perceived (Study 2), and manipulated economic inequality (Studies 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b). In the correlational studies, both objective and perceived economic inequality were associated with greater con­ spiracy beliefs. In the experiments, participants in the high (compared to the low) inequality condition were more likely to endorse conspiratorial narratives. This effect was fully mediated by anomie (Studies 3a, 3b) suggesting that inequality enhances the perception that society is breaking down (anomie), which in turn in­ creases conspiratorial thinking, possibly in an attempt to regain some sense of order and control. Furthermore, the link between economic inequality and conspiracy beliefs was stronger when participants endorsed a con­ spiracy worldview (Studies 4a, 4b).

  {"id":"cataldiMeaslesMediaMMR2016","abstract":"Objective\nIn late 2014, a measles outbreak beginning in California received significant media attention. To better understand the impact of this outbreak, we conducted a survey to assess and compare among vaccine hesitant and non-hesitant new mothers how this outbreak affected vaccine knowledge, attitudes, vaccination plans, and media use.\nMethods\nA cross-sectional email survey of English-speaking women with a child ⩽1year old using a convenience sample of women from nine obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) practices in Colorado assessed vaccine hesitancy, knowledge and attitudes about MMR vaccines and the outbreak, MMR vaccination plans before and after the outbreak, and use of and trust for media sources related to the outbreak.\nResults\nThe response rate was 50% (351/701). Knowledge about the outbreak was high and vaccination attitudes were mostly favorable. Forty-eight percent of respondents thought MMR vaccine was more important after the outbreak. Online news (76%), television news (75%), and social media (68%) were the most frequently used media sources, yet were highly trusted by only 18%, 22%, and 1% of respondents respectively. Government websites (34%) and information from a doctor’s office (34%) were infrequently used, but were highly trusted by 62% and 60% of respondents. Knowledge of the outbreak was lower among vaccine-hesitant respondents. Few mothers changed MMR vaccination plans after the outbreak.\nConclusions\nNew mothers had high levels of knowledge and favorable attitudes about vaccination after the 2014–15 measles outbreak. Media sources used the most are not the most trusted. Communication about outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases should include spread of accurate information to new media sources and strengthening of existing trust in traditional media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cataldi","given":"Jessica R."},{"family":"Dempsey","given":"Amanda F."},{"family":"O’Leary","given":"Sean T."}],"citation-key":"cataldiMeaslesMediaMMR2016","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.048","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"50","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,7]]},"language":"en","page":"6375-6380","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Measles, the media, and MMR: Impact of the 2014–15 measles outbreak","title-short":"Measles, the media, and MMR","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16309835","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"cattoScienceReligionNonreligion2022","abstract":"Within the last 20 years sociological research on science and religion has provided new insights that challenge myths regarding conflicts between science and religion. Gaps in pre-existing work have been identified resulting in major shifts in the field. In particular, research has employed more mixed methods, widened its scope to become more international, and expanded to include nonreligion. Building upon these developments and critiques, this chiefly conceptual article explores a way to move forward by combining three fields of research in a novel way: the sociology of religion, the sociology of nonreligion, and the Public Understanding of Science (PUS). These subfields all touch on relevant and interrelated topics. Sociology of religion contributes to parceling out aspects of belief, identity, and practice; focuses on lived experience along with positionality, normative commitments, and culture. The sociology of nonreligion draws more detailed attention to the association between science and secularism. Finally, including research on PUS provides resources for understanding trust in, and engagement with science dialogically, as well as lessons for effective public engagement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Catto","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Riley","given":"James"},{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Stephen H."},{"family":"Leicht","given":"Carola"}],"citation-key":"cattoScienceReligionNonreligion2022","container-title":"Acta Sociologica","DOI":"10.1177/00016993221116248","ISSN":"0001-6993","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,7]]},"language":"en","page":"00016993221116248","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Science, religion, and nonreligion: Engaging subdisciplines to move further beyond mythbusting","title-short":"Science, religion, and nonreligion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00016993221116248"},

  {"id":"cavaliereReligiousInstitutionsJapan2021","abstract":"Abstract This paper discusses adaptations and alternatives that religious institutions in Japan have formulated to help communities develop the capacity to cope with the crisis and perceived risk generated by Covid-19. Qualitative data and observations of online information were collected between February and June 2020. Guided by a crisis approach, the study explores inward and outward responses that some Japanese religious institutions and their members have enacted. The investigation uses Douglas’ (1994) interpretative model of risk and explores those “thought-styles” that religious institutions have engendered that are conducive to cohesion and stability. Findings show that established and new religions alike swiftly responded to Covid-19-induced safety measures by embracing digital technology to continue their core function as cohesion-providers for their social and spiritual communities. The analysis shows that adjustments toward disembodied religious practices might hold potential to continue beyond current Covid-19-related social restrictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cavaliere","given":"Paola"}],"citation-key":"cavaliereReligiousInstitutionsJapan2021","container-title":"Journal of Religion in Japan","DOI":"10.1163/22118349-20200006","ISSN":"2211-8349, 2211-8330","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"31-63","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"Religious Institutions in Japan Responding to Covid-19-Induced Risk and Uncertainty: Some Preliminary Considerations","title-short":"Religious Institutions in Japan Responding to Covid-19-Induced Risk and Uncertainty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/jrj/10/1/article-p31_2.xml","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"cavojovaAssessingFluidRationality2019","abstract":"A new tri-partite model of rational thinking (Stanovich, 2011) allows for assessing various aspects of rational decision making. Because of assumed multi-faceted nature of rationality, it is necessary to establish which measuring paradigms are best suited to assess it. 531 participants (31% men,), with mean age of 27.61 (SD=7.8) took part in the present study. We examined relationships between several testing paradigms from JDM literature, such as the jelly bean task (Kirkpatrik, Epstein, 1992), cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005) and Wason´s selection task. Higher scores in these testing paradigms are hypothesized to constitute a resistance to miserly processing. We also examined two other dimensions of fluid rationality: temporal discounting of the reward and acceptance of risk (Frederick, 2005), and several measures of cognitive style containing a preference for intuition or deliberation (PID, REI, CoSi, MBTI). The lack of strong mutual relationships between these measures, together with low internal consistency for a composite score of resistance to miserly processing, rather undermined the construct of miserly processing. There were also very weak relationships with other constructs hypothesized to be other dimensions of fluid rationality besides resistance to miserly processing. Such results seem to support Stanovich's (2011) hypothesis about multifactorial fluid rationality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Čavojová","given":"Vladimíra"},{"family":"Hanák","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"cavojovaAssessingFluidRationality2019","DOI":"10.54941/ahfe100185","event-title":"International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessing Fluid Rationality and Its Relations to Cognitive Styles","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.cms-conferences.org/publications/book/978-1-4951-2095-4/article/978-1-4951-2095-4_2"},

  {"id":"celnikerPreferencesPriorsMotivated2024","abstract":"Despite decades of research, it has been difficult to resolve debates about the existence and nature of partisan bias—the tendency to evaluate information more positively when it supports, rather than challenges, one’s political views. Whether partisans display partisan biases, and whether any such biases reflect motivated reasoning, remains contested. We conducted four studies (total N = 4,010) in which participants who made unblinded evaluations of politically relevant science were compared to participants who made blinded evaluations of the same study. The blinded evaluations—judgments of a study’s quality given before knowing whether its results were politically congenial—served as impartial benchmarks against which unblinded participants’ potentially biased evaluations were compared. We also modeled the influence of partisans’ preferences and prior beliefs to test accounts of partisan judgment more stringently than past research. Across our studies, we found evidence of politically motivated reasoning, as unblinded partisans’ preferences and prior beliefs independently biased their evaluations. We contend that conceptual confusion between descriptive and normative (e.g., Bayesian) models of political cognition has impeded the resolution of long-standing theoretical debates, and we discuss how our results may help advance more integrative theorizing. We also consider how the blinding paradigm can help researchers address further theoretical disputes (e.g., whether liberals and conservatives are similarly biased), and we discuss the implications of our results for addressing partisan biases within and beyond social science.

Results show that while religiosity is on average negatively associated with the five outcomes, the relationship between religiosity and orientations towards science varies by country such that religiosity is sometimes positively associated with the different outcomes.

We pre-registered and conducted a systematic review of the 2017 issues from three psychology of religion journals. We aimed to identify the extent to which the psychology of religion has embraced Open Science practices and the role of RDF within the subfield. We found that many of the methodologies that help to increase transparency, such as pre-registration, have yet to be adopted by those in the subfield.

We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model—identification with “Euromaidan” increased beliefs in the annexation-related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters’ actions in the setting of intergroup conflict.

Recent research has focused on whether religions create problems or are sources of solution or support in these extraordinary times. Although some studies document religious leaders’ and institutions’ innovative responses to preserve ritual practices and foster members’ sense of belonging, they fail to highlight lay practitioners’ bottom-up religious transformations. Noting this, this article draws on the case of Lufeng city in south China to examine how local residents inventively reconfigured the temporal-spatiality of their ritual practices during temple lock-downs. Through an ethnographic-style exploration, we reveal multi-faceted spatial changes in the ritual performance, including the reconfiguration of home spaces, the performance of worship practices outside temple doors and the mobilization of digital spaces of communication to accumulate good fortune. Apart from these spatial strategies, local ritual transformation also produces temporal adaptations. Through these temporal-spatial reconfigurations, local residents innovatively cope with new social circumstances and articulate religion’s continual significance.

  {"id":"chinnExpandingDimensionsEpistemic2011","abstract":"Psychological and educational researchers have developed a flourishing research program on epistemological dimensions of cognition (epistemic cognition). Contemporary philosophers investigate many epistemological topics that are highly relevant to this program but that have not featured in research on epistemic cognition. We argue that integrating these topics into psychological models of epistemic cognition is likely to improve the explanatory and predictive power of these models. We thus propose and explicate a philosophically grounded framework for epistemic cognition that includes five components: (a) epistemic aims and epistemic value; (b) the structure of knowledge and other epistemic achievements; (c) the sources and justification of knowledge and other epistemic achievements, and the related epistemic stances; (d) epistemic virtues and vices; and (e) reliable and unreliable processes for achieving epistemic aims. We further argue for a fine-grained, context-specific analysis of cognitions within the five components.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chinn","given":"Clark A."},{"family":"Buckland","given":"Luke A."},{"family":"Samarapungavan","given":"Ala"}],"citation-key":"chinnExpandingDimensionsEpistemic2011","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.2011.587722","ISSN":"0046-1520","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",7,1]]},"page":"141-167","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Expanding the Dimensions of Epistemic Cognition: Arguments From Philosophy and Psychology","title-short":"Expanding the Dimensions of Epistemic Cognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2011.587722","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"chouOnceBittenTwice2022","abstract":"From financial improprieties to fraudulent claims, scandals and trust transgressions can incite feelings of betrayal. Can these negative reactions spillover and taint other entities that were not involved in the original transgression? We conducted six studies to investigate this question directly. Results consistently demonstrated that people who had perceived a recent betrayal by a transgressing trustee were significantly less likely to trust a new entity that shared nominal group membership with the previous trust transgressor. This betrayal spillover effect occurs both in economic game environments and can be applied to real-world charitable contexts in which people made actual donation decisions or assessed the likelihood that a charity would be embroiled in a scandal in the future. Importantly, the betrayal spillover effect only spilled over to those that shared a nominal group identity with the original trust transgressor, and this behavior was driven by a sense of distrust stemming from people’s expectations having been violated. By systematically investigating whether and to what extent betrayals can contaminate subsequent trust development, this research provides a deeper and broadened understanding on how one may be vicariously affected by other entities’ trust indiscretions.

Narcissistic in-group positivity captures a belief in in-group greatness that is contingent on external validation. It reﬂects defensive in-group positivity, insofar as it stems from the frustration of individual needs, and predicts increased sensitivity to threats as well as undesirable consequences for out-groups and the in-group. Secure in-group positivity—that is, in-group positivity without the narcissistic component—is a conﬁdently held positive evaluation of one’s in-group that is independent of the recognition of the group in the eyes of others. It stems from the satisfaction of individual needs, is resilient to threats and has positive consequences for the in-group and out-groups.

  {"id":"cindelj.m.whiteBeliefKarmaHow2019","abstract":"Abstract   Karma is believed to be a source of supernatural justice through which actions lead to morally congruent outcomes, within and across lifetimes. It is a central tenet of many world religions and appears in the social evaluations expressed by religious and non-religious individuals across diverse cultural contexts. Despite its prevalence, research directly investigating belief in karma is currently underrepresented in psychological studies of religion, morality, and justice. In this chapter, we situate karma within existing theories of religious cognition and justice beliefs, while highlighting how it is related to, but distinct from, belief in moralizing gods, beliefs about justice that lack religious or supernatural connotations, and magical thinking. We first describe two prominent explanations for the cross-cultural prevalence of supernatural justice beliefs: These beliefs arise as the by-products of other, more general cognitive mechanisms, and these beliefs are supported by core motivations for sense-making, meaning maintenance, and psychological control. We then consider how questions left unresolved by these cognitive and motivational perspectives, regarding the cross-cultural variability in explicit supernatural justice beliefs, can be explained through a cultural evolutionary perspective on religious cognition. Finally, we describe how these supernatural justice beliefs affect causal judgments and elicit norm-adherence and prosociality among believers.","author":[{"literal":"Cindel J. M.

We explore the social, psychological, and institutional causes and consequences of scientific censorship (defined as actions aimed at obstructing particular scientific ideas from reaching an audience for reasons other than low scientific quality). Popular narratives suggest that scientific censorship is driven by authoritarian officials with dark motives, such as dogmatism and intolerance. Our analysis suggests that scientific censorship is often driven by scientists, who are primarily motivated by self-protection, benevolence toward peer scholars, and prosocial concerns for the well-being of human social groups. This perspective helps explain both recent findings on scientific censorship and recent changes to scientific institutions, such as the use of harm-based criteria to evaluate research. We discuss unknowns surrounding the consequences of censorship and provide recommendations for improving transparency and accountability in scientific decision-making to enable the exploration of these unknowns. The benefits of censorship may sometimes outweigh costs. However, until costs and benefits are examined empirically, scholars on opposing sides of ongoing debates are left to quarrel based on competing values, assumptions, and intuitions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Clark","given":"Cory J."},{"family":"Jussim","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Komi"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Sean T."},{"family":"Gharbi","given":"Musa","non-dropping-particle":"al-"},{"family":"Aquino","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"J.

  {"id":"clementTrustNotTrust2010","abstract":"Philosophers agree that an important part of our knowledge is acquired via testimony. One of the main objectives of social epistemology is therefore to specify the conditions under which a hearer is justified in accepting a proposition stated by a source. Non-reductionists, who think that testimony could be considered as an a priori source of knowledge, as well as reductionists, who think that another type of justification has to be added to testimony, share a common conception about children development. Non-reductionists believe that infants and children are fundamentally gullible and their gullibility could be seen as an example for justifying testimony, while reductionists believe that this gullibility is merely an exception that should be taken into account. The objective of this paper is to review contemporary literature in developmental psychology providing empirical grounds likely to clarify this philosophical debate. What emerges from current research is a more elaborated vision of children’s attitude toward testimony. Even at a very young age, children do not blindly swallow information coming from testimony; doubtful or contradictory information is automatically screened by their cognitive system. Even if they are unable to give positive reasons for the acceptance of a given testimony, young children are not gullible. Such empirical findings tend to call into question the radical opposition between reductionism and non-reductionism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Clément","given":"Fabrice"}],"citation-key":"clementTrustNotTrust2010","container-title":"Review of Philosophy and Psychology","container-title-short":"Rev.Phil.Psych.","DOI":"10.1007/s13164-010-0022-3","ISSN":"1878-5166","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"531-549","source":"Springer Link","title":"To Trust or not to Trust?

  {"id":"cliffordImprovedQuestionFormat2019","abstract":"In an era of increasing partisan polarization and media fragmentation, interest in the causes of conspiracy beliefs has been growing rapidly. However, there is little consensus on how to measure these beliefs. Researchers typically present respondents with a conspiratorial statement, then assess their endorsement of the statement using an agree-disagree scale, a true-false scale, or some other variant. Researchers sometimes include a no-opinion response option and sometimes do not. Yet, there is little evidence as to the best format. In this article, we argue that common measures not only are challenging for respondents to answer, but also inflate estimates of conspiracy belief among the mass public. We introduce an alternative measure that presents respondents with an explicit choice between a conspiratorial and a conventional explanation for an event. Across three studies, the explicit choice format reduces no-opinion responding and reduces estimates of conspiracy belief, particularly among those low in political knowledge or cognitive reflection. These results suggest that previous findings may be inflated due to measurement artifacts. This evidence suggests that researchers adopt the explicit choice format for measuring conspiracy beliefs and provide a no-opinion response option.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yongkwang"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Brian W"}],"citation-key":"cliffordImprovedQuestionFormat2019","container-title":"Public Opinion Quarterly","DOI":"10.1093/poq/nfz049","ISSN":"0033-362X, 1537-5331","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"690-722","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Improved Question Format for Measuring Conspiracy Beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/83/4/690/5717683","volume":"83"},

Religious and ideological propositions are the typical examples of believed propositions. Moreover, the radical empiricist worldview so often associated with modern science has eroded society's meaningful sense of life. Western history, however, shows that knowledge and belief have not always been constructed separately. In addition, modern developments in the philosophy and history of science have seriously undermined the radical empiricist's excessive confidence in scientific methods. Acknowledging in the science classroom the parallel structure of knowledge and belief, and recognizing that science requires a presuppositional foundation that is itself not empirically verifiable would re introduce a valuable discussion on the meaning of science and its impact on life.

Several limitations of previous research about intercultural competence are demonstrated, e.g., approaching culture as a nationally shared, homogenous, mental program developed through socialization, or as a communicative system associated with a single and unitary group identification. The author also problematizes instances when communication competence is presented as an individual impression rather than a contextually and relationally contingent process of negotiation and struggle. The author offers examples from her program of research that began in 1989 to illustrate how she began to give more attention to contextual factors, status hierarchies and power relations and differential benefits for diverse parties in intercultural encounters. The essay concludes with further recommendations related to how to incorporate broader notions of macro, meso and micro contexts, approach cultures as plural and contested; attend to status positions of interactants as negotiated and dynamic; and ensure that outcomes and consequences of intercultural competence research and training are oriented toward justice, equity and inclusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Collier","given":"Mary Jane"}],"citation-key":"collierInterculturalCommunicationCompetence2015","collection-title":"Intercultural Competence","container-title":"International Journal of Intercultural Relations","container-title-short":"International Journal of Intercultural Relations","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.03.003","ISSN":"0147-1767","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"9-11","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Intercultural communication competence: Continuing challenges and critical directions","title-short":"Intercultural communication competence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176715000267","volume":"48"},

A large body of results in the psychology of motivated-reasoning has put pressure on the empirical adequacy of this view. The present study extends this body of results by providing direct evidence that the moral offensiveness of a scientific hypothesis biases explanatory judgment along several dimensions, even when prior credence in the hypothesis is controlled for. Furthermore, it is shown that this bias is insensitive to an economic incentive to be accurate in the evaluation of the evidence.

The present study examined two research questions: (1) how do epistemological beliefs change over time? and (2) what role do gender, ethnicity, SES, and achievement play in their development? The study was correlational with an ethnically diverse sample of 187 fifth grade students (46% Latino, 27% Anglo, and 27% African American, and 67% low SES). Self-report questionnaires that tapped four dimensions of beliefs (source, certainty, development, and justification) were given to students at two time points during the course of a nine-week science unit. Results showed that students became more sophisticated in their beliefs about source and certainty of knowledge over time, but that there were no reliable changes in development and justification. There also were no main or moderating effects of gender or ethnicity, but there were main effects of SES and achievement. Low SES and low achieving children had less sophisticated beliefs in comparison to average SES and high achieving children. There were no significant interactions between gender, ethnicity, SES, and achievement for any of the four belief measures. Results are discussed in terms of personal and contextual factors and their role in the facilitation of epistemological belief development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Conley","given":"AnneMarie M"},{"family":"Pintrich","given":"Paul R"},{"family":"Vekiri","given":"Ioanna"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Delena"}],"citation-key":"conleyChangesEpistemologicalBeliefs2004","collection-title":"Epistemological Development and Its Impact on Cognition in Academic Domains","container-title":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","container-title-short":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cedpsych.2004.01.004","ISSN":"0361-476X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"186-204","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Changes in epistemological beliefs in elementary science students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X04000050","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"cookDeconstructingClimateMisinformation2018","abstract":"Misinformation can have signiﬁcant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the inﬂuence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identiﬁcation of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and ﬁnd that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientiﬁc consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"John"},{"family":"Ellerton","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kinkead","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"cookDeconstructingClimateMisinformation2018","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","DOI":"10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f","ISSN":"1748-9326","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"024018","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Deconstructing climate misinformation to identify reasoning errors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/13/i=2/a=024018?key=crossref.bbcd2fbe0d8d787a4637abb66826b93c","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"cookMisinformationHowCorrect2015","abstract":"The increasing prevalence of misinformation in society may adversely affect democratic decision making, which depends on a well-informed public. False information can originate from a number of sources including rumors, literary fiction, mainstream media, corporate-vested interests, governments, and nongovernmental organizations. The rise of the Internet and user-driven content has provided a venue for quick and broad dissemination of information, not all of which is accurate. Consequently, a large body of research spanning a number of disciplines has sought to understand misinformation and determine which interventions are most effective in reducing its influence. This essay summarizes research into misinformation, bringing together studies from psychology, political science, education, and computer science. Cognitive psychology investigates why individuals struggle with correcting misinformation and inaccurate beliefs, and why myths are so difficult to dislodge. Two important findings involve (i) various “backfire effects,” which arise when refutations ironically reinforce misconceptions, and (ii) the role of worldviews in accentuating the persistence of misinformation. Computer scientists simulate the spread of misinformation through social networks and develop algorithms to automatically detect or neutralize myths. We draw together various research threads to provide guidelines on how to effectively refute misconceptions without risking backfire effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"John"},{"family":"Ecker","given":"Ullrich"},{"family":"Lewandowsky","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"cookMisinformationHowCorrect2015","container-title":"Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0222","editor":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Robert A"},{"family":"Kosslyn","given":"Stephan M"}],"event-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","ISBN":"978-1-118-90077-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","publisher-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Misinformation and How to Correct It","type":"chapter","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0222"},

  {"id":"cookUnderstandingCounteringClimate","abstract":"Science denial causes a range of damaging impacts on society. This is particularly the case with climate science denial, which has resulted in strong polarization around a non-controversial scientific issue, and prolific dissemination of climate misinformation. This in turn has had the effect of reducing public acceptance of climate change, and eroding support for policies to mitigate climate change. In order to develop effective responses to science denial, it is necessary to first understand the drivers of science denial, which leads to deeper understanding of the techniques employed to cast doubt on the reality of climate change. Analysis of denialist techniques can inform development of interventions that neutralize misinformation. Inoculation has been shown to be an effective way to preemptively reduce the influence of climate science denial. Two methods to practically implement inoculation are misconception-based learning (teaching science by addressing scientific misconceptions) and technocognition (an interdisciplinary approach that implements psychological principles in the design of technological solutions to misinformation). Interventions and procedures developed for the countering of climate misinformation may also be applied to other scientific topics rife with misinformation, such as vaccination and evolution.","author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"cookUnderstandingCounteringClimate","language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Understanding and countering climate science denial","type":"article-journal"},

Experiment 1 found that a subtle reminder of death increased disparagement, social distancing, and distrust of atheists. Experiment 2 found that asking people to think about atheism increased the accessibility of implicit death thoughts. These studies provide the first empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Corey L."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Florette"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Sheldon"}],"citation-key":"cookWhatIfTheyre2015","container-title":"Social Psychological and Personality Science","DOI":"10.1177/1948550615584200","ISSN":"1948-5506","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"840-846","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What If They’re Right About the Afterlife?

  {"id":"cookWorldScaryPlace2018","abstract":"Research suggests that people chronically concerned with safety, as measured by the Belief in a Dangerous World (BDW) Scale, are prone to intergroup prejudice and likely to endorse negative stereotypes under conditions eliciting concern for safety. Using a sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice, the current research tested whether people with high BDW report increased prejudice specifically toward groups stereotypically associated with safety-related threats compared to groups associated with unrelated threats. Studies 1 and 2 found that higher BDW predicts increased negativity, safety-related concern, and fear toward groups stereotypically associated with threats to safety (e.g., illegal immigrants and Muslims) compared to groups thought to pose unrelated threats (e.g., gay men and obese people). Study 3 activated concern for safety using a news story detailing increased crime (vs. a control story), finding an interaction between safety concern activation, target group, and BDW, such that situational threat concern elicited greater prejudice toward Mexican Americans, but not toward Asian Americans, from those participants with higher BDW. These studies suggest that individual differences in concern for safety predict specific prejudices (e.g., fear and social distancing) toward distinct groups rather than general outgroup negativity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Corey L."},{"family":"Li","given":"Yexin Jessica"},{"family":"Newell","given":"Steve M."},{"family":"Cottrell","given":"Catherine A."},{"family":"Neel","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"cookWorldScaryPlace2018","container-title":"Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","container-title-short":"Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","DOI":"10.1177/1368430216670024","ISSN":"1368-4302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"584-596","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The world is a scary place: Individual differences in belief in a dangerous world predict specific intergroup prejudices","title-short":"The world is a scary place","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430216670024","volume":"21"},

This is due largely to the extreme religiosity of the United States, which is much higher than that of comparably advanced nations, and to the resistance of many religious people to the facts and supposed implications of evolution. The prevalence of religious belief in the United States suggests that outreach by scientists alone will not have a huge effect in increasing the acceptance of evolution, nor will the strategy of trying to convince the faithful that evolution is compatible with their religion. Because creationism is a symptom of religion, another strategy to promote evolution involves loosening the grip of faith on America. This is easier said than done, for recent sociological surveys show that religion is highly correlated with the dysfunctionality of a society, and various measures of societal health show that the United States is one of the most socially dysfunctional First World countries. Widespread acceptance of evolution in America, then, may have to await profound social change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Coyne","given":"Jerry A."}],"citation-key":"coyneScienceReligionSociety2012","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01664.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"2654-2663","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Science, Religion, and Society: The Problem of Evolution in America","title-short":"Science, Religion, and Society","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01664.x","volume":"66"},

Some hold that these expressions do not express genuine beliefs because they do not meet the standards of rationality, coherence and integration which govern beliefs. So they must serve some other function. But this picture of ‘genuine belief’ is inadequate, for reasons independent of the phenomenon of religion.

  {"id":"croucherPrejudiceAsianAmericans2020","abstract":"The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has brought increased incidents of racism, discrimination, and violence against “Asians,” particularly in the United States, with reports of hate crimes of over 100 per day. Since January 2020, many Asian Americans have reported suffering racial slurs, wrongful workplace termination, being spat on, physical violence, extreme physical distancing, etc., as media and government officials increasingly stigmatise and blame Asians for the spread of Covid-19. The links with social media are increasingly evident, as anti-Asian sentiment increases, with reports of anti-Asian sentiment spreading and Asian-Americans fighting hate via social media. Using integrated threat theory, this study explores the links between prejudice/hate toward Asians-Americans, in particular Chinese, and social media use. Three key results emerged from the study. First, the more a social media user believes their most used daily social media is fair, accurate, presents the facts, and is concerned about the public (social media believe), the more likely that user is to believe Chinese pose a realistic and symbolic threat to America. Second, men and women significantly differed on each type of prejudice, with men scoring higher on intergroup anxiety and women higher on symbolic and realistic threat. Third, respondents who do not use social media on a daily basis are less likely than those who use Facebook to perceive Chinese as a symbolic threat. Implications and recommendations for practitioners, health workers and government are proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Croucher","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Thao"},{"family":"Rahmani","given":"Diyako"}],"citation-key":"croucherPrejudiceAsianAmericans2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Communication","container-title-short":"Front.

From these intergroup emotions and stereotypes, the behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes (BIAS) map predicts distinct behaviors: active and passive, facilitative and harmful. After defining warmth/communion and competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or warm but not competent.

This article serves as a review of studies investigating the correlations between political ideology, religiosity, right-wing authoritarianism, ingroups/outgroups, and prejudice in an attempt to describe and understand the well-established links between these dimensions. We discuss several group-level theories including Terror Management Theory, Social Identity Theory, Realistic Group Conflict Theory among others to frame the intercorrelations of these constructs in an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms that drive individuals to embody religious and political beliefs. We then discuss individual-level cognitive and psychological differences such as intelligence, cognitive flexibility, and specific biological and neurological limitations of brain function that may influence people to adopt certain religious and political beliefs. Through a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of religious and political extremism, we may be better equipped to assuage the fear and denigration that is associated with many of these beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuevas","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Bryan L."}],"citation-key":"cuevasIntegratedReviewRecent2021","container-title":"Psychological Reports","container-title-short":"Psychol Rep","DOI":"10.1177/0033294120925392","ISSN":"0033-2941","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"977-1014","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"An Integrated Review of Recent Research on the Relationships Between Religious Belief, Political Ideology, Authoritarianism, and Prejudice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294120925392","volume":"124"},

But is this how people think beliefs ought to be formed? We addressed this question across three studies and found that, across a diverse set of everyday situations, people treat moral considerations as legitimate grounds for believing propositions that are unsupported by objective, evidence-based reasoning. We further document two ways in which moral considerations affect how people evaluate others' beliefs. First, the moral value of a belief affects the evidential threshold required to believe, such that morally beneficial beliefs demand less evidence than morally risky beliefs. Second, people sometimes treat the moral value of a belief as an independent justification for belief, and on that basis, sometimes prescribe evidentially poor beliefs to others. Together these results show that, in the folk ethics of belief, morality can justify and demand motivated reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cusimano","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Lombrozo","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"cusimanoMoralityJustifiesMotivated2021","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104513","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"page":"104513","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Morality justifies motivated reasoning in the folk ethics of belief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720303322","volume":"209"},

Psychologists have long assumed that people are unaware of these biases and operate under an “illusion of objectivity.” We identify an important domain of life in which people harbor little illusion about their biases – when they are biased for moral reasons. For instance, people endorse and feel justified believing morally desirable propositions even when they think they lack evidence for them (Study 1a/1b). Moreover, when people engage in morally desirable motivated reasoning, they recognize the influence of moral biases on their judgment, but nevertheless evaluate their reasoning as ideal (Studies 2–4). These findings overturn longstanding assumptions about motivated reasoning and identify a boundary condition on Naïve Realism and the Bias Blind Spot. People's tendency to be aware and proud of their biases provides both new opportunities, and new challenges, for resolving ideological conflict and improving reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cusimano","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Lombrozo","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"cusimanoPeopleRecognizeCondone2023","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105379","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105379","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"People recognize and condone their own morally motivated reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027723000136","volume":"234"},

In an effort at conceptual integration the survey results were used to examine the relationships between three concepts of trust. Perceived agreement in values between self and four controversy‐involved groups was found to be the most powerful predictor of trust of all four groups, as expected by the salient value similarity perspective. “Fairness” and “competency,” as expected by the “dimensions” of trust perspective were also found to be significant predictors of trust. However, judgments of “fairness” and “competency” were context specific as indicated by significant correlations with judgments of salient value similarity and self interests. This violates the assumption of universality of the “dimensions” of trust perspective. Judgments of similarity of values between self and the controversy‐involved groups were significantly correlated to self interests.

  {"id":"dagnallEvaluationBeliefScience2019","abstract":"The Belief in Science Scale (BISS) is a unidimensional measure that assesses the degree to which science is valued as a source of superior knowledge. Due to increased academic interest in the concept of belief in science, the BISS has emerged as an important measurement instrument. Noting an absence of validation evidence, the present paper, via two studies, evaluated the scale’s factorial structure. Both studies drew on data collected from previous research. Study 1 (N = 686), using parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis, identified a unidimensional solution accounting for 56.43% of the observed variance. Study 2 (N = 535), using an independent sample, tested the unidimensional solution using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Data-model fit was good (marginal for RMSEA): CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.09 (90% CI of 0.08 to 0.10), SRMR = 0.04. Invariance testing across gender supported invariance of form, factor structure, and item intercepts for this one-factor model. BISS at the overall level correlated negatively with the reality testing dimension of the Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO-RT), demonstrating convergent validity. Researchers often use the IPO-RT as an indirect index of preference for experiential processing (intuitive thinking). In this context, only BISS scores above the median (second quartile) produced a reduction in experiential-based thinking.

Arguments are then given for and against each of Barbour’s four models: conflict, independence, integration and dialogue. In contradiction of the recent trend to dismiss the conflict model as overly “simplistic”, I conclude that it is the clear front-runner. Critical examination reveals that theology (the academic face of religion) typically proceeds by first affirming belief in God and then seeking rationalisations that protect this belief against contrary evidence.

In this first part of a two-part article, I set out the wide-ranging background required for a proper understanding of the debate as a preliminary for the second part, in which Ian Barbour ’s influential four-fold typology of science-religion relations is critically assessed, leading to the conclusion that the conflict model is not to be so easily dismissed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Damper","given":"R.

Repeated retrieval of target means upon goal activation was expected to result in inhibition of competing means for the same goal. In all studies, participants studied goal—means combinations and subsequently practiced the retrieval of certain means to attain the goals in a retrieval paradigm. Study 1 tested accessibility of the different means in a goal—means verification task and showed that competing means were not inhibited after a single retrieval but only upon repeated retrieval (three or nine times). Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings in a means—recognition task and demonstrated that inhibition occurred in the absence of explicit intent or instructions to suppress the competitors. These inhibitory effects of competing means are discussed against the background of current social cognition research on the processes underlying goal—means networks and the formation of habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Danner","given":"Unna N."},{"family":"Aarts","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Vries","given":"Nanne K.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"dannerHabitFormationMultiple2007","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1177/0146167207303948","ISSN":"0146-1672","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1367-1379","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Habit Formation and Multiple Means to Goal Attainment: Repeated Retrieval of Target Means Causes Inhibited Access to Competitors","title-short":"Habit Formation and Multiple Means to Goal Attainment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167207303948","volume":"33"},

In Study 1, a survey of 204 undergraduate students revealed that their religious fundamentalism was linked indirectly to greater emphasis on obedience in a hypothetical child-rearing situation through the desire to keep their children in their religious faith; and to greater approval of corporal punishment through greater valuation of obedience. In Study 2, 83 mothers and 71 fathers of university students responded to a questionnaire designed to examine the hypotheses that while parents' religious fundamentalism would be negatively related to their endorsement of child autonomy, it would be positively linked to stronger desires to keep children in their religious faith, to greater emphasis on obedience and to greater approval of corporal punishment in child-rearing. Also, it was expected that parents' right-wing authoritarian attitudes would be linked to their fundamentalist religious orientation, as well as to greater emphasis on obedience and approval of corporal punishment. Results from the zero-order correlations were in keeping with the hypotheses. However, a mediation (regression) analysis indicated that parents' right-wing authoritarianism was a better predictor of their child-rearing attitudes than was religious fundamentalism. Fundamentalism, however, proved important in predicting parents' goal of socializing their children to accept their religious faith.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Danso","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Hunsberger","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Pratt","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"dansoRoleParentalReligious1997","container-title":"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion","DOI":"10.2307/1387686","ISSN":"0021-8294","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"496-511","publisher":"[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Role of Parental Religious Fundamentalism and Right-Wing Authoritarianism in Child-Rearing Goals and Practices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1387686","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"davidsonScienceOutreachReligious2017","abstract":"Public resistance to well established scientific understanding has been a persistent problem in the US. Decades of improved educational materials, upgraded K-12 standards, and several successful court battles to curb anti-science influences did little to change the percentage of Americans resistant to even considering the evidence for subjects such as evolution or ancient Earth history. Research in the social sciences suggests that one reason has been a failure to recognize the importance of the source of information. Studies have documented that people are more receptive to challenging viewpoints when the advocate (the source) is recognized as a member of their own group or \"tribe.\" The personal worldview or group-identity of an expert can determine how willing an audience is to consider the argument, much more so than the expert's scientific credentials. For a religious audience, this means that the quality of educational materials and the strength of an argument may be irrelevant if delivered by someone known to be dismissive of fundamental religious beliefs. In contrast, significant inroads have been realized with the religious public when scientists of faith have taken a pro-science message to members of their own religious affiliations. Encouraging stories are coming from outreach efforts of organizations and programs such as BioLogos, American Scientific Affiliation, Solid Rock Lectures, and AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion. Secular scientists interested in outreach can benefit greatly by keeping a short list of resources (blogs, books, speakers) by religious scientists advocating for the legitimacy of modern science, or by directly teaming with scientists of faith. A recent example from our own efforts includes an 11 author book, The Grand Canyon, Monument to an Ancient Earth, aimed primarily at the Christian public to explain why Noah's flood does not explain the planet's complex geology. Eight authors are Christians and three are not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Davidson","given":"G.

The extant literature explains this pattern in terms of a rational motivation to blame the social system for prejudice and discrimination. However, little research distinguishes between race-relevant conspiracy theories against African Americans and general conspiracy theories. We propose that African Americans may seek out race-relevant conspiracy theories in particular because they satisfy a search for meaning that is brought about by chronic social devaluation. We present two studies that examine this social devaluation hypothesis. In Study 1 African Americans endorsed race-relevant conspiracy theories, even when controlling for perceptions of discrimination, an aspect of system blame. Study 2 employed an experimental affirmation of social value that significantly reduced African Americans’ endorsement of race-relevant conspiracy theories consistent with the social devaluation hypothesis. These data indicate there may be psychologically adaptive features of race-relevant conspiracy theory endorsement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"James"},{"family":"Wetherell","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Henry","given":"P.J."}],"citation-key":"davisSocialDevaluationAfrican2018","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Eur.

Parents expressed confidence in the existence of various scientific and religious phenomena but were more confident that scientific phenomena exist. Moreover, even though Iranian parents expressed a high valuation of both science and religion, their valuation of science was higher than that of religion.

For many, the answer to the former question is unknown; the answer to the latter question is a mystery. Across three studies testing a largely Christian sample within the United States (N = 2524), we investigate attitudes toward ignorance and inquiry as a window onto scientific versus religious belief. In Experiment 1, we find that science and religion are associated with different forms of ignorance: scientific ignorance is typically expressed as a personal unknown (“it's unknown to me”), whereas religious ignorance is expressed as a universal mystery (“it's a mystery”), with scientific unknowns additionally regarded as more viable and valuable targets for inquiry. In Experiment 2, we show that these forms of ignorance are differentially associated with epistemic goals and norms: expressing ignorance in the form of “unknown” (vs. “mystery”) more strongly signals epistemic values and achievements. Experiments 2 and 3 additionally show that ignorance is perceived to be a greater threat to science and scientific belief than to religion and religious belief.

Based on this evidence, we argue that cultural input plays a central role in the development of belief about supernatural unobservables as real, whereas it plays a less critical role in the development of belief about natural unobservables as real.

Drawing on evidence from psychological research and the writings of scientists and science communicators, I argue that awe and wonder play a crucial role in scientific discovery. They focus our attention on the natural world, encourage open-mindedness, diminish the self (particularly feelings of self-importance), help to accord value to the objects that are being studied, and provide a mode of understanding in the absence of full knowledge. I will flesh out implications of the role of awe and wonder in scientific discovery for debates on the relationship between science and religion. Abraham Heschel argued that awe and wonder are religious emotions because they reduce our feelings of self-importance, and thereby help to cultivate the proper reverent attitude towards God. Yet metaphysical naturalists such as Richard Dawkins insist that awe and wonder need not lead to any theistic commitments for scientists. The awe some scientists experience can be regarded as a form of non-theistic spirituality, which is neither a reductive naturalism nor theism.

  {"id":"degaregeIntegrativeBehaviorTheory2019","abstract":"The study examined factors that affect parental intention-to-vaccinate adolescent daughters with HPV vaccine in Mysore district, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1609 parents of adolescent girls attending schools in Mysore District between February 2010 and October 2011. A validated questionnaire was used to assess parental attitudes, beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer, HPV vaccine and vaccination in general. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate parameters and assess whether a model based on the integrative behavior theory would fit the current data. More than two-thirds (78.0%) of parents would accept vaccinating their daughters with HPV vaccine. Intention to HPV vaccination significantly increased with increase in the perception of parents about the benefits (standardized regression coefficient (β) = 0.39) or sources of information about HPV vaccine (β = 0.24), but intention decreased significantly with an increase in the perception about barriers to HPV vaccination β = -0.44). The effect of beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (β = 0.20), and beliefs about benefits (β = 0.20) or barriers (β = -0.25) to vaccination in general on intention to HPV vaccination were significantly mediated by parental attitudes and source of information about the vaccine. Geographical location significantly moderated the awareness about HPV on beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (β = 0.33), and the effect of religion on norms related to HPV vaccination (β = 0.19). Fit of the model to the data was acceptable. This study identified modifiable parental attitudes about HPV vaccine and beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer and vaccination, which predicted parental intention-to-vaccinate their daughters with HPV vaccine in India. Health education interventions tailored to counter parental negative attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccine and vaccination in general would be important for the community to promote HPV vaccination.","author":[{"family":"Degarege","given":"Abraham"},{"family":"Krupp","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Fennie","given":"Kristopher"},{"family":"Srinivas","given":"Vijaya"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tan"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Dionne P."},{"family":"Madhivanan","given":"Purnima"}],"citation-key":"degaregeIntegrativeBehaviorTheory2019","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.012","ISSN":"1873-2518","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"945-955","PMCID":"PMC6351189","PMID":"30655176","source":"PubMed","title":"An integrative behavior theory derived model to assess factors affecting HPV vaccine acceptance using structural equation modeling","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

The results provide evidence that items of the CRPR can be used to form reliable scales for assessing child rearing dimensions (Nurturance and Restrictiveness) or patterns of child rearing (Authoritarian and Authoritative pattern) in the Dutch sample. Especially important are the findings concerning the construct validity of these scales. The results show that the CRPR scores differentiate between parents of different-sociometric-status children. Finally, it seems that parental self-report using CRPR corresponds with actual parental behavior in interaction with the child.

The somatic and psychological effects of common everyday hassles were investigated. Overall, there was a significant relationship between daily stress and the occurrence of both concurrent and subsequent health problems such as flu, sore throat, headaches, and backaches. The relationship of daily stress to mood disturbance was more complex. The negative effects of stress on mood were limited to a single day, with the following day characterized by mood scores that were better than usual. Furthermore, striking individual differences were found in the extent to which daily stress was associated with health and mood across time. Participants with unsupportive social relationships and low self-esteem were more likely to experience an increase in psychological and somatic problems both on and following stressful days than were participants high in self-esteem and social support. These data suggest that persons with low psychosocial resources are vulnerable to illness and mood disturbance when their stress levels increase, even if they generally have little stress in their lives.

  {"id":"demunterRiskFactorsPersisting2018","abstract":"Background: Measles is an infectious disease providing lifelong immunity. Epidemics periodically occur among unvaccinated orthodox Protestants in the Netherlands. During the 2013/2014 epidemic, 17% of the reported patients was over 14 years old. Apparently, they did not catch measles during the previous 1999/2000 epidemic and remained susceptible. We wanted to identify risk factors for this so-called persisting measles susceptibility, and thus risk factors for acquiring measles at older age with increased risk of complications.\nMethods: A case-control study was performed among unvaccinated orthodox Protestants born between 1988 and 1998; cases had measles in 2013/2014, controls during or before 1999/2000. Associations between demographic, geographical and religion-related determinants and persisting measles susceptibility were determined using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Analyses were stratified in two age-groups: infants/toddlers and primary school-aged children during the 1999/2000 measles epidemic.\nResults: In total, 204 cases and 563 controls were included. Risk factors for persisting measles susceptibility for infants/toddlers in 1999/2000 were belonging to a moderately conservative church, absence of older siblings and residency outside low vaccination coverage (LVC)-municipalities. Risk factors for primary school-aged children were residency outside LVC-municipalities and attendance of non-orthodox Protestant primary school.\nConclusion: Unvaccinated orthodox Protestant adolescents and adults who resided outside the LVC-municipalities, did not attend an orthodox Protestant primary school, had no older siblings and belonged to a moderately conservative church were at risk for persisting measles susceptibility and, thus, for acquiring measles at older age with increased risk of complications. For this subgroup of orthodox Protestants targeted information on vaccination is recommended.","author":[{"family":"Munter","given":"Anne C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Tostmann","given":"Alma"},{"family":"Hahné","given":"Susan J.

The goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the independence of these types of intuition and (2) examine the relationships between each type and various thinking styles, beliefs, and cognitions. Results confirmed the distinction among of the types of intuition and established their differential relationships to other relevant constructs including need for cognition, rumination, religiosity, spirituality, conservatism, cognitive reflection, scientific reasoning, and bullshit receptivity. Affective intuition was associated with participants' religious and political beliefs and with lower levels of cognitive reflection and scientific reasoning. Holistic intuition was positively associated with thinking styles such as need for cognition and the propensity to ruminate. Inferential intuition was not strongly related to any of the measures used in this study, perhaps because our tasks did not rely on domain expertise.

However, research over the last four decades suggests the possibility that, both conceptually and empirically, intelligence could be integrated with larger models of personality. Such an integration may allow a more unified conception of the structure and sources of individual differences. Since the previous edition of this handbook, the prospect for integrating intelligence with personality has been strengthened by new research clarifying the relation of intelligence to broad taxonomies of personality. The first purpose of this chapter is to explore the conceptual relation of intelligence to personality.

  {"id":"dieguezNothingHappensAccident2015","abstract":"Belief in conspiracy theories has often been associated with a biased perception of randomness, akin to a nothinghappens-by-accident heuristic. Indeed, a low prior for randomness (i.e., believing that randomness is a priori unlikely) could plausibly explain the tendency to believe that a planned deception lies behind many events, as well as the tendency to perceive meaningful information in scattered and irrelevant details; both of these tendencies are traits diagnostic of conspiracist ideation. In three studies, we investigated this hypothesis and failed to find the predicted association between low prior for randomness and conspiracist ideation, even when randomness was explicitly opposed to malevolent human intervention. Conspiracy believers’ and nonbelievers’ perceptions of randomness were not only indistinguishable from each other but also accurate compared with the normative view arising from the algorithmic information framework.

Ukrainian media and politicians have also been accused of using propaganda and deception, although such efforts have been much more limited than Russia's disinformation campaign. Both Russia and Ukraine exaggerate the losses they claim to have inflicted on each other.Russian propaganda and fake news stories have attacked Ukraine's right to exist and accused it of being a neo-Nazi state, committing genocide against Russian speakers, developing nuclear and biological weapons, and being influenced by Satanism. Russian propaganda also accuses NATO of controlling Ukraine and building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia. Some of this disinformation has been spread by Russian web brigades. It has been widely rejected as untrue and crafted to justify the invasion and even to justify genocidal acts against Ukrainians. The Russian state has denied carrying out war crimes in Ukraine, and Russian media has falsely blamed some of them on Ukrainian forces instead. Some of the disinformation seeks to undermine international support for Ukraine and to provoke hostility against Ukrainian refugees.\nRussian disinformation has been pervasive and successful in Russia itself, due to censorship of war news and state control of most media. Because of the amount of disinformation, Russian media has been restricted and its reputation has been tarnished in many Western and developed countries. However, the Russian state has had more success spreading its views in many developing countries. In particular, Chinese state media has been largely sympathetic to the Russian side, and has repeatedly censored war news or reproduced Russian fake news and disinformation.\nDescriptions of Ukraine-sponsored disinformation have focused on over-optimistic casualty reports, as well as promotion of patriotic stories such as the Ghost of Kyiv that were later discredited.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,23]]},"citation-key":"DisinformationRussianInvasion2024","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1197932559","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disinformation_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine&oldid=1197932559"},

  {"id":"dittoLeastBiasBipartisan2019","abstract":"Both liberals and conservatives accuse their political opponents of partisan bias, but is there empirical evidence that one side of the political aisle is indeed more biased than the other? To address this question, we meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies, involving over 18,000 participants, that examined one form of partisan bias—the tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one’s political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances. Two hypotheses based on previous literature were tested: an asymmetry hypothesis (predicting greater partisan bias in conservatives than in liberals) and a symmetry hypothesis (predicting equal levels of partisan bias in liberals and conservatives). Mean overall partisan bias was robust (r = .245), and there was strong support for the symmetry hypothesis: Liberals (r = .235) and conservatives (r = .255) showed no difference in mean levels of bias across studies. Moderator analyses reveal this pattern to be consistent across a number of different methodological variations and political topics. Implications of the current findings for the ongoing ideological symmetry debate and the role of partisan bias in scientific discourse and political conflict are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ditto","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Brittany S."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Cory J."},{"family":"Wojcik","given":"Sean P."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Grady","given":"Rebecca H."},{"family":"Celniker","given":"Jared B."},{"family":"Zinger","given":"Joanne F."}],"citation-key":"dittoLeastBiasBipartisan2019","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691617746796","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"273-291","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"At Least Bias Is Bipartisan: A Meta-Analytic Comparison of Partisan Bias in Liberals and Conservatives","title-short":"At Least Bias Is Bipartisan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691617746796","volume":"14"},

Proponents argue that these messages neutralize the effect of people’s political worldviews due to the neutral scientific character of the message. Yet this argument has not undergone extensive testing. Addressing this, we measured participants’ thoughts on scientists featured in messages emphasizing scientific agreement on politically dissonant issues. Our results show that readers often produce less favorable thoughts and moral judgments when scientists agree on a politically dissonant issue.

  {"id":"dodickPhilosophicalApproachesReligious2010","abstract":"This research examines the problems that religious Jewish science teachers in Israeli high schools have in coping with science subjects (such as geological time) which conflict with their religious beliefs. We do this by characterizing the philosophical approaches within Judaism that such teachers have adopted for dealing with such controversy. Thus, we surveyed 56 religious teachers using a Likert‐type questionnaire developed for this research, as well as interviewed 11 teachers to more deeply probe their approaches. In addition, we surveyed 15 religious scientists, so that we could both contrast their views with our teacher samples as well as to better understand their coping strategies when confronted by scientific topics that challenge their beliefs. Results indicated that no single philosophical approach earned overwhelming support from the teachers or scientists. Instead, most of the subjects relate separately to each source of possible conflict in accordance with the philosophical approach that appears to be the most fruitful for resolving such conflicts. Moreover, both the scientists and the teachers felt less conflicted toward the specific subject of geological time, in comparison to issues connected to creation of the earth and (especially) evolution. The teachers did differ from the scientists in their preference toward philosophical approaches which help them better integrate the domains of science and religion. Based on our findings, we are able to suggest a set of strategies to help teachers overcome their difficulties in teaching ‘controversial’ science topics to a religiously oriented student population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Dodick","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Dayan","given":"Aliza"},{"family":"Orion","given":"Nir"}],"citation-key":"dodickPhilosophicalApproachesReligious2010","container-title":"International Journal of Science Education","DOI":"10.1080/09500690903518060","ISSN":"0950-0693","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,15]]},"page":"1521–1548","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Philosophical Approaches of Religious Jewish Science Teachers Toward the Teaching of ‘Controversial’ Topics in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500690903518060","volume":"32"},

The current research examined how presenting social equality between ethnic groups in terms of moral ideals (i.e., equal treatment) vs. moral obligations (i.e., non-discrimination) affected the attitudes of Whites (students in Study 1, N=45 and 2, N=44 and employees in Study 3a, N=67 and Study 3b, N=62) toward various social equality issues. It was found that participants in the moral ideals condition reported more activation rather than inhibition tendencies regarding equality (Study 1), were more supportive of affirmative action (Study 2), indicated lower levels of social identity threat, and were more favorable toward cultural diversity which resulted in greater prioritization of equality (Study 3a) than those in the moral obligation condition. These effects did not arise when the ideals/obligations distinction was applied to a nonmoral domain (i.e., competence, Study 3b), underlining the central argument that these processes are specific to morality.

  {"id":"domekMeasuringVaccineHesitancy2018","abstract":"Background\nDespite safe and effective childhood immunizations, decreased acceptance of vaccines has become an emerging global problem. The WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy developed a common diagnostic tool, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS), to identify and compare hesitancy in different global settings. We field tested the VHS in rural and urban Guatemala.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the enrollment visit of a study conducted at four public health clinics in Guatemala. Infants ages 6 weeks-6 months presenting for their first wellness visit were enrolled March-November 2016. Parents completed a demographic survey that included the 10 dichotomous and 10 Likert scale VHS questions. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact for categorical and ANOVA test for continuous variables were used to assess significance levels in survey differences. We conducted a factor analysis to assess the Likert scale questions.\nResults\nOf 1088 families screened, 871 were eligible and 720 (82.7%) participated. No parent had ever refused a vaccination, and only eight parents (1.1%) had been reluctant or hesitated to get a vaccination for their children. However, only 40.8% (n = 294) of parents said that they think most parents like them have their children vaccinated with all the recommended vaccines. Factor analysis identified two underlying constructs that had eigenvalues of 1.0 or greater and a substantive lack of variability in response across the Likert scale. There were consistent differences between how study clinics responded to the ordinal scaling.\nConclusion\nOur results suggest problems with interpretation of the VHS, especially in the presence of vaccine shortages and using a Likert scale that does not resonate across diverse cultural settings. Our factor analysis suggests that the Likert scale items are more one-dimensional and do not represent the multiple constructs of vaccine hesitancy. We suggest more work is needed to refine this survey for improved reliability and validity.

  {"id":"douglasClimateChangeWhy2015","abstract":"Uncertainty surrounds the public understanding of climate change and provides fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Typically, such conspiracy theories assert that climate scientists and politicians are distorting or hijacking the science to suit their own purposes. Climate change conspiracy theories resemble other conspiracy theories in some respects, but in others they appear to be quite different. For example, climate change conspiracy theories appear to be motivated by the desire to deny or minimize an unwelcome and threatening conclusion. They also appear to be more contentious than other types of conspiracy theories. Perhaps to an unparalleled extent, people on both sides of the issue champion climate change conspiracy theories. Finally, more than other conspiracy theories, those concerning climate change appear to be more politically loaded, dividing opinion across the left-right continuum. Some empirical evidence suggests that climate change conspiracy theories may be harmful, steering people away from environmentally friendly initiatives. They therefore present a significant challenge for governments and environmental organizations that are attempting to convince people to take action against global warming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Sutton","given":"Robbie M."}],"citation-key":"douglasClimateChangeWhy2015","container-title":"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists","DOI":"10.1177/0096340215571908","ISSN":"0096-3402, 1938-3282","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1]]},"language":"en","page":"98-106","source":"Crossref","title":"Climate change: Why the conspiracy theories are dangerous","title-short":"Climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1177/0096340215571908","volume":"71"},

In Study 1 (N D 202) participants were more likely to agree with a range of conspiracy theories if they also tended to attribute intentionality and agency to inanimate objects. As predicted, this relationship accounted for the link between education level and belief in conspiracy theories.

The last decade, however, has seen an increase in social psychological research on this topic that has yielded many insights into the causes and consequences of conspiracy thinking. In this article, we draw on examples from our own programme of research to highlight how the methods and concepts of social psychology can be brought to bear on the study of conspiracy theories. Specifically, we highlight how basic social cognitive processes such as pattern perception, projection, and agency detection predict the extent to which people believe in conspiracy theories. We then highlight the role of motivations such as the need for uniqueness, and the motivation to justify the system, in predicting the extent to which people adopt conspiracy explanations. We next discuss how conspiracy theories have important consequences for social life, such as decreasing engagement with politics and influencing people’s health and environmental decisions.

For moral guidance we human beings may be tempted to turn toward the past (scripture, tradition), toward present science, or toward future consequences.

That makes the question of where to look for guidance potentially a central one for religion and science, setting the agenda differently from apologetic questions with respect to religion or to science. However, “religion and science” does not solve the issues, leading to a single normative perspective; the way that current knowledge is integrated with past wisdom is highly dependent upon ideals that relate to the future. Thus, rather than resolving the need for guidance, the religion-and-science conversation becomes one way of addressing our need for guidance, bringing into the conversation past, present, and future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Drees","given":"Willem B."}],"citation-key":"dreesWhereLookGuidance2004","container-title":"Zygon®","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9744.2004.00580.x","ISSN":"1467-9744","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"367-378","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Where to Look for Guidance?

  {"id":"drummondEmotionJudgmentsScientific2020","abstract":"Scientific research has the power to prompt strong emotional reactions. We investigated the relationship between such reactions and individuals’ understanding and judgments of the research. Participants read an article describing recent cancer research and reported the extent to which it evoked six emotions: fear, anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise. We modeled these emotions two ways, either considering each separately or clustering them into two groups, for emotions with positive or negative valence. Even after controlling for the number of predictors, models based on the six separate emotions better predicted participants’ subjective understanding of the research, judgments of its quality, and trust in the scientists who conducted it. Participants who reported more disgust also had more negative judgments of the research and the scientists, but these relationships were weaker when participants reported their emotions before making these judgments, rather than after. We discuss practical and ethical implications of these results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Drummond","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Fischhoff","given":"Baruch"}],"citation-key":"drummondEmotionJudgmentsScientific2020","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662520906797","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"319-334","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Emotion and judgments of scientific research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520906797","volume":"29"},

We ask whether individuals with more general education and greater science knowledge, measured in terms of science education and science literacy, display more (or less) polarized beliefs on several such issues. We report secondary analyses of a nationally representative dataset (the General Social Survey), examining the predictors of beliefs regarding six potentially controversial issues. We find that beliefs are correlated with both political and religious identity for stem cell research, the Big Bang, and human evolution, and with political identity alone on climate change. Individuals with greater education, science education, and science literacy display more polarized beliefs on these issues. We find little evidence of political or religious polarization regarding nanotechnology and genetically modified foods.

We ask whether such a pattern is observed in public attitudes toward scientific controversies of a previous era. In secondary analyses of a major national survey, we examine social and individual factors associated with attitudes toward scientific controversies in the period 1979–1990. Our source is the National Science Foundation’s nationally representative Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology, which asked about public attitudes toward nuclear power, food additives, genetic engineering, space exploration, human evolution, the Big Bang, and human/dinosaur co-occurrence. Despite some inconsistency in the measurement of key variables, the data reveal consistent relationships within topics and across survey-years: political ideology predicted polarization of attitudes toward nuclear power, while religiosity predicted polarization of attitudes toward genetic engineering, space exploration, human evolution, and the Big Bang. Unlike results from more recent surveys, respondents with more education and greater scientific knowledge were no more polarized by politics or religion, with the possible exception of attitudes toward human evolution.

Different factors influence vaccine hesitancy and these are context-specific, varying across time and place and with different vaccines. Factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence are involved. Acceptance of vaccines may be decreasing and several explanations for this trend have been proposed. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has recognized the global importance of vaccine hesitancy and recommended an interview study with immunization managers (IMs) to better understand the range of vaccine hesitancy determinants that are encountered in different settings. Interviews with IMs in 13 selected countries were conducted between September and December 2013 and various factors that discourage vaccine acceptance were identified. Vaccine hesitancy was not defined consistently by the IMs and most interpreted the term as meaning vaccine refusal. Although vaccine hesitancy existed in all 13 countries, some IMs considered its impact on immunization programmes to be a minor problem. The causes of vaccine hesitancy varied in the different countries and were context-specific, indicating a need to strengthen the capacity of national programmes to identify the locally relevant causal factors and to develop adapted strategies to address them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Dubé","given":"Eve"},{"family":"Gagnon","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Nickels","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Jeram","given":"Stanley"},{"family":"Schuster","given":"Melanie"}],"citation-key":"dubeMappingVaccineHesitancy2014","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.09.039","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"49","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"6649-6654","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mapping vaccine hesitancy—Country-specific characteristics of a global phenomenon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14013073","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"eckerCanCorrectionsSpread2020","abstract":"Misinformation often continues to influence inferential reasoning after clear and credible corrections are provided; this effect is known as the continued influence effect. It has been theorized that this effect is partly driven by misinformation familiarity. Some researchers have even argued that a correction should avoid repeating the misinformation, as the correction itself could serve to inadvertently enhance misinformation familiarity and may thus backfire, ironically strengthening the very misconception that it aims to correct. While previous research has found little evidence of such familiarity backfire effects, there remains one situation where they may yet arise: when correcting entirely novel misinformation, where corrections could serve to spread misinformation to new audiences who had never heard of it before. This article presents three experiments (total N = 1718) investigating the possibility of familiarity backfire within the context of correcting novel misinformation claims and after a 1-week study-test delay. While there was variation across experiments, overall there was substantial evidence against familiarity backfire. Corrections that exposed participants to novel misinformation did not lead to stronger misconceptions compared to a control group never exposed to the false claims or corrections. This suggests that it is safe to repeat misinformation when correcting it, even when the audience might be unfamiliar with the misinformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Ecker","given":"Ullrich K.

One factor proposed to explain the ineffectiveness of retractions is that repeating misinformation during a correction may inadvertently strengthen the misinformation by making it more familiar. Practitioners are therefore often encouraged to design corrections that avoid misinformation repetition. The current study tested this recommendation, investigating whether retractions become more or less effective when they include reminders or repetitions of the initial misinformation. Participants read fictional reports, some of which contained retractions of previous information, and inferential reasoning was measured via questionnaire. Retractions varied in the extent to which they served as misinformation reminders. Retractions that explicitly repeated the misinformation were more effective in reducing misinformation effects than retractions that avoided repetition, presumably because of enhanced salience. Recommendations for effective myth debunking may thus need to be revised.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ecker","given":"Ullrich K.H."},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Lewandowsky","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"eckerRemindersRepetitionMisinformation2017","container-title":"Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.jarmac.2017.01.014","ISSN":"22113681","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"language":"en","page":"185-192","source":"Crossref","title":"Reminders and Repetition of Misinformation: Helping or Hindering Its Retraction?","title-short":"Reminders and Repetition of Misinformation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211368116301838","volume":"6"},

In contrast to public opinion and scholarly discourse, most scientists do not perceive a conflict between science and religion. Different from what other studies would indicate, this belief does not vary between social and natural scientists. We argue that maintaining plausibility frameworks for religion is an important correlate of whether scientists will reject the conflict paradigm, with such frameworks taking surprising forms. When scientists do not attend religious services they are more likely to accept the conflict paradigm. When scientists think their peers have a positive view of religion, they are less likely to agree there is a conflict between science and religion. Religious upbringing is associated with scientists adopting the conflict paradigm. Spirituality is much more important in this population than other research would lead us to believe.

Residents of two English urban regions rated their trust in six potential sources of information about the risk of contaminated land in their neighborhood (independent scientists; local council property developers; residents' groups; friends and family; local media), and how expert, open, accurate, or biased these sources were and how much they had residents' interests at heart. Overall, scientists were trusted most and developers least, but this was only partly due to their greater perceived expertise. Resident groups and friends/family were also trusted, despite being seen as relatively inexpert, since they scored highly on openness and shared interests, these latter two attributes being more important predictors of trust in individual sources than perceived expertise. We conclude that, where a source is seen as motivated to withhold, distort, or misinterpret information, this will undermine public trust even in apparently knowledgeable sources, hence supporting the view that trust depends on a combination of perceived expertise and perceived motives as complementary processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Eiser","given":"J.

However, a 2009 British Council poll undertaken in 10 countries worldwide shows that the perception of a necessary clash between evolutionary worldviews and belief in a God is a minority viewpoint. How then does the popular conception that there is an ongoing conflict between evolution and belief in God arise? One contributing factor is the framing and categorization of creationism and evolutionism within large-scale surveys for use within media campaigns. This article examines the issue framing within four polls conducted in the United Kingdom and internationally between 2008 and 2013.

In this multidisciplinary volume, experts in history and philosophy of science, oral history, sociology of religion, social psychology, and science communication and public engagement look beyond two warring systems of thought. They consider a far more complex, multifaceted, and distinctly more interesting picture of how differing groups along a spectrum of worldviews-including atheistic, agnostic, and faith groups-relate to and form the ongoing narrative of a necessary clash between evolution and faith. By ascribing agency to the public, from the nineteenth century to the present and across Canada and the United Kingdom, this volume offers a much more nuanced analysis of people's perceptions about the relationship between evolutionary science, religion, and personal belief, one that better elucidates the complexities not only of that relationship but of actual lived experience\"--","call-number":"BL240.3 .I34 2020","citation-key":"elsdon-bakerIdentitySecularAge2020","editor":[{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"},{"family":"Lightman","given":"Bernard V."}],"event-place":"Pittsburgh, PA","ISBN":"978-0-8229-4628-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, PA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Identity in a secular age: science, religion, and public perceptions","title-short":"Identity in a secular age","type":"book"},

The chapter begins by highlighting the fundamental difficulty with multi- or cross- disciplinary research into science, belief and society – which in part relates to the lack of social science researchers who can adequately provide open minded insight into both ‘science’ and ‘religion’. The authors contend that the nuance and complexity of how these two knowledge systems interact in diverse social contexts can be lost due to implicit disciplinary biases. Too often in academic discourse, they argue, scholars lose sight of the multi-layered and relational ways in which members of a variety of ‘publics’ relate to ‘science’. Rather than assuming that ‘publics’ negative responses to scientific research simply transect various epistemological, ontological, ethical narratives, the authors maintain that we need to situate people’s positions within a complex system of geopolitical, cultural and social contexts that lead to individuals’ positions on scientific issues acting as an identity marker across a spectrum of religious, spiritual, non-religious and atheistic publics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"},{"family":"Mason-Wilkes","given":"Will"}],"citation-key":"elsdon-bakerSociologicalStudyScience2019","container-title":"Science, Belief and Society","ISBN":"978-1-5292-0696-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,22]]},"language":"en","page":"3-24","publisher":"Bristol University Press","section":"Science, Belief and Society","source":"bristoluniversitypressdigital.com","title":"The Sociological Study of Science and Religion in Context","type":"chapter","URL":"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/display/book/9781529206968/ch001.xml"},

It reviews research that tests aspects of this theory and highlights the critical role of epistemological beliefs in learning. An important issue to address is the development and modification of epistemological beliefs. Whether children are born with an “epistemological scheme” is unclear. In 1984 at the presidential address for the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Richard C. Anderson stated that: It stands to reason that beliefs about knowledge that a child develops will be influenced by those of his parents. Alan Schoenfeld has suggested those students’ beliefs about quick and easy mathematical solutions and failure to integrate mathematical concepts may be a product of how they are taught. The development of these beliefs may be due to cultural, familial, and educational influences.

Employing unique data from two national surveys that includes respondent beliefs in 27 conspiracy theories, we decipher the substantive dimensions along which conspiracy beliefs are organized, as well as subgroupings within those dimensions. We find that variation in these conspiracy beliefs can be accounted for with two dimensions: the first regards partisan and ideological identities, while the other is composed of anti-social orientations, such as narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and acceptance of political violence. Importantly, these two dimensions are uncorrelated. We also find that conspiracy beliefs group together by substantive content, such as those regarding partisan actors or science/medicine. Our findings also demonstrate that inferences about the correlates of conspiracy beliefs are highly contingent on the specific conspiracy theories employed by researchers.

Psychological research makes it clear that \"motivated beliefs\" are guided by motivated reasoning--reasoning in the service of some self-interest, to be sure, but reasoning nonetheless. People generally reason their way to conclusions they favor, with their preferences influencing the way evidence is gathered, arguments are processed, and memories of past experience are recalled.

  {"id":"erduranArgumentationInterdisciplinarityReflections2019","abstract":"Argumentation has emerged as a key area of research and development in science education in recent years. Simply defined, argumentation is about the justification of knowledge claims with evidence and reasons. Although there is now a vast amount of work in argumentation, much research remains to be pursued. Given the interdisciplinary nature of argumentation, the dialogue between science education and other relevant domains can potentially produce constructive research agendas that could profit argumentation research and lead to practical applications. Following an overview of the relevant interdisciplinary investigations that can be pursued in science education, the paper subsequently focuses on the interphase of science and religion. Although science education research has witnessed considerable debate about particular issues related to science and religion such as the teaching and learning of evolution and creationism, the role of argumentation remains an uncharted territory. Hence, the paper focuses on how argumentation may be explored in science and religious education in comparison. Some preliminary observations from the Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science (OARS) Project are reported including a comparative analysis of curricula and teachers’ views.

  {"id":"etkinDoesVarietyActivities2016","abstract":"Does variety increase happiness? Eight studies examine how the variety among the activities that fill people’s day-to-day lives affects subsequent happiness. The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people’s sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and leisure, self-selected and imposed, social and solo).

  {"id":"etkinDynamicImpactVariety2012","abstract":"Consumers often have a variety of products that they may use to help them pursue their goals. These products constitute a set of means toward consumers’ goal attainment. This article investigates (1) how the amount of variety (high vs. low) among a set of means affects motivation to pursue the associated goal and (2) how this relationship changes over the course of goal pursuit as progress is made toward goal attainment. Five studies demonstrate that when progress toward goal attainment is low, having more variety within a set of means to goal attainment increases motivation to pursue the goal. However, when progress toward goal attainment is high, having less variety within a set of means to goal attainment increases motivation to pursue the goal. These findings suggest perceived variety among means is an important determinant of motivation in goal pursuit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Etkin","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Ratner","given":"Rebecca K."}],"citation-key":"etkinDynamicImpactVariety2012","container-title":"Journal of Consumer Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Consumer Research","DOI":"10.1086/661229","ISSN":"0093-5301","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,1]]},"page":"1076-1092","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Dynamic Impact of Variety among Means on Motivation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1086/661229","volume":"38"},

Six studies demonstrate that consumers are more motivated and willing to pay for means to goal attainment in the near term when they plan to use a set of different (vs. similar) means. In contrast, consumers are more motivated and willing to pay for means to goal attainment in the long term when they plan to use similar (vs. different) means. For example, consumers paid more for a personal training session when told it would include exercises for different (similar) muscle groups and would take place this week (next month).

  {"id":"evansContradictoryComplementaryCreationist2011","abstract":"Almost half of the US public rejects the idea that humans originated via evolution rather than by supernatural design. Moreover, studies demonstrate that even biology teachers have difficulty teaching their students about evolution, often including creationist explanations as well. A typical response to such findings is the argument that greater exposure to evolutionary theory would eliminate these unscientific alternatives. However, creationist ideas are not easily extinguished. Even after repeated exposure to evolutionary concepts, creationist ideas are more likely to be <i>incorporated</i> into hybrid frameworks along with evolutionary ideas, rather than completely rejected. Thus, members of the public often find these ideas complementary rather than contradictory. In this review, we apply dual-process theory to examine individuals’ understandings of the origins of species. We describe cognitive biases that operate at the intuitive-autonomous level (system 1), some of which, we argue, anchor belief in supernatural design, and others of which potentially anchor evolutionary ideas. At the other end of the continuum, reflective and abstract reasoning (system 2) processes are apparent in both scientific and theological explanations of origins. We conclude that presenting supernatural and natural explanations of biological origins as contradictory belies the way they function in everyday reasoning. By understanding the theological and the scientific arguments as well as the way most people intuitively reason about such existential questions, teachers might be better prepared to deal with these issues in the classroom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"E.

  {"id":"evansEpistemologicalMoralConflict2011","abstract":"Debates about religion and educational attainment often assume that members of certain religious groups do not seek out knowledge of science because they are opposed to the use of the scientific method. Using the science module of the 2006 General Social Survey, the analysis indicates that no religious group differs from the nonreligious comparison group in its propensity to seek out scientific knowledge. A more subtle epistemological conflict may arise when scientists make claims that explicitly contradict theological accounts. Findings indicate that Protestants and Catholics differ from the comparison group only on the very few issues where religion and science make competing claims. A third possible source of conflict may not be epistemological, but rather derives from opposition to what is understood as the public moral agenda of scientists.

A need now exists for more comprehensive, reliable, concise measurement of religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles through a scale that covers multiple domains. This article describes the development and initial validation of a 26-item measure, the Religious and Spiritual Struggles (RSS) Scale. The measure assesses six domains of r/s struggle: divine (negative emotion centered on beliefs about God or a perceived relationship with God), demonic (concern that the devil or evil spirits are attacking an individual or causing negative events), interpersonal (concern about negative experiences with religious people or institutions; interpersonal conflict around religious issues), moral (wrestling with attempts to follow moral principles; worry or guilt about perceived offenses by the self), doubt (feeling troubled by doubts or questions about one’s r/s beliefs), and ultimate meaning (concern about not perceiving deep meaning in one’s life). Study 1 used factor analytic techniques in two adult samples (Ns ϭ 400 and 483) to refine the item pool for the RSS. Study 2, which sampled 1141 undergraduates, showed very good fit for a six-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 also provided evidence of convergent, discriminant and predictive validity by relating RSS scores to measures of religiousness, r/s struggle and mental health. Several potentially important demographic differences emerged on the RSS. For example, undergraduates without committed romantic relationships and those who self-identified as homosexual reported greater r/s struggles across multiple domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Exline","given":"Julie J."},{"family":"Pargament","given":"Kenneth I."},{"family":"Grubbs","given":"Joshua B."},{"family":"Yali","given":"Ann Marie"}],"citation-key":"exlineReligiousSpiritualStruggles2014","container-title":"Psychology of Religion and Spirituality","container-title-short":"Psychology of Religion and Spirituality","DOI":"10.1037/a0036465","ISSN":"1943-1562, 1941-1022","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8]]},"language":"en","page":"208-222","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale: Development and initial validation.","title-short":"The Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0036465","volume":"6"},

False intellectual humility is situated in a virtue epistemological framework, where it is contrasted with intellectual humility, understood as excellence in self-attribution of intellectual weakness. False intellectual humility characteristically takes the form of insincere expressions of ignorance or uncertainty – as when dogmatically committed conspiracy theorists insist that they just want to know what’s going on – and, in such cases, false intellectual humility is a kind of false skepticism or false fallibilism. In connection with this, the chapter further explores the relationship between the concepts of intellectual humility, skepticism, and fallibilism. A distinction can be drawn between the virtues of intellectual humility, skepticism, and fallibilism, but the traditional association of skepticism and fallibilism with intellectual humility is vindicated by the fact that the virtues of intellectual humility, skepticism, and fallibilism overlap.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"citation-key":"FalseIntellectualHumility2020","DOI":"10.4324/9781351107532-33","ISBN":"978-1-351-10753-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,15]]},"language":"en","page":"313-324","publisher":"Routledge","source":"www.taylorfrancis.com","title":"False intellectual humility","type":"book","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781351107532-33/false-intellectual-humility-allan-hazlett"},

In Experiment 2, participants primed with mortality (vs. participants in a control condition) reported greater belief in science.

Second, we conduct two studies (n = 1189 and n = 1097) to confirm our working hypotheses: H1 ? intercorrelation between pseudoscientific beliefs, authoritarianism and three axioms (reward for application, religiosity and fate control); H2 ? authoritarianism and social axioms fully explain rightists? proneness to pseudoscience; and H3 ? the association between pseudoscience and authoritarianism is partially mediated by social axioms. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to their external validity regarding paranormal and conspiracy beliefs, as well as to their implications for group polarisation and science communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fasce","given":"Angelo"},{"family":"Adrián-Ventura","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Avendaño","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"fasceRomansAuthoritarianRoots2020","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662520935078","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"597-613","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Do as the Romans do: On the authoritarian roots of pseudoscience","title-short":"Do as the Romans do","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520935078","volume":"29"},

The results show heterogeneous interactions between six constructs: (1) conspiracy theories poorly interact with scientific literacy; (2) there are major differences between attitudinal and practical dimensions of critical thinking; (3) paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs show similar associations (they are predicted by scientific knowledge and trust in science); and (4), only scientific knowledge interacts with other predictor of unwarranted beliefs, such as ontological confusions.

  {"id":"fealyApocalypticThoughtConspiracism2019","abstract":"The impact of apocalyptic and conspiracist discourses on Indonesian jihadi thinking and behaviour has been little studied, but evidence in recent years is mounting that it has been significant. Many Indonesians who joined Islamic State forces in Syria and Iraq from 2013 were driven in part by a belief that the final cataclysmic battle between Islam and its foes would occur there imminently, and the families responsible for the 2018 Surabaya suicide bombing which killed more than two dozen people were convinced that the world would soon end. This article examines Indonesia’s contemporary apocalyptic literature, with an emphasis on the two main genres: populist and jihadist. It argues that the populist forms, though sensational, highly conspiratorial and commercially motivated, are more insidious than commonly assumed, and can have a “priming effect” upon radicalizing readers by deepening their sense of crisis and grievance, thus inclining them to extreme views and actions. Jihadi apocalypticism has a stronger scholarly basis, but is subject to serious debate and some scepticism within Islamist circles. For some jihadis, such discourses bring a compelling urgency that triggers violence, but for others, apocalypticism is viewed more warily due to the risk that it impairs judgement and leads to erroneous strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fealy","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"fealyApocalypticThoughtConspiracism2019","container-title":"Contemporary Southeast Asia","ISSN":"0129-797X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"63-85","publisher":"ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute","source":"JSTOR","title":"Apocalyptic Thought, Conspiracism and Jihad in Indonesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26664205","volume":"41"},

In this study, we test hypotheses suggesting that system identity threat, or a perception that society’s fundamental, defining values are under siege due to social change, will predict conspiracy thinking. Across two samples (N = 870, N = 2,702), we found that system identity threat is a strong predictor of a general tendency toward conspiracy thinking and endorsement of both ideological and non-ideological CTs, even after accounting for numerous covariates. We also found that the relationship between systemidentity threat and conspiracy-theory endorsement is mediated by conspiracy thinking. These results suggest that conspiracy-theory endorsement may be a compensatory reaction to perceptions that society’s essential character is changing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Federico","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Allison L."},{"family":"Vitriol","given":"Joseph A."}],"citation-key":"federicoRoleSystemIdentity2018","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1002/ejsp.2495","ISSN":"00462772","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"927-938","source":"Crossref","title":"The role of system identity threat in conspiracy theory endorsement","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ejsp.2495","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"feenerMuslimReligiousAuthority2014","abstract":"The social, economic, and political transformations of the past two centuries have been rapid and dramatic, resulting in complex reconfigurations of religious author­ ity in many Muslim societies. These changes have involved not only the emergence of distinctly new profiles of leadership, but also the persistence and adaptation of the models established by the ulama of the classical period. The challenges of modernizing reform at the turn ofthe twentieth century struck at the very heart oftraditions that had bolstered established religious authority for a thousand years. In the modern period, ulama find themselves in increasingly crowded and highly contested public spheres in which they can no longer hold any kind of monopoly. Contemporary debates in Muslim public spheres are characterized by the emergence of complex new discursive formu­ lations on issues of religious belief and practice, individual rights and responsibilities, and proper standards of public morality. This essay provides an historical introduction to the emergence of diverse models of Muslim religious authority in modem Asia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Feener","given":"R. Michael"}],"citation-key":"feenerMuslimReligiousAuthority2014","container-title":"Asian Journal of Social Science","container-title-short":"Asian J Soc Sci","DOI":"10.1163/15685314-04205002","ISSN":"1568-4849, 1568-5314","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"501-516","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Muslim Religious Authority in Modern Asia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/ajss/42/5/article-p501_2.xml","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"feinbergUnderstandingProcessMoralization2019","abstract":"A large literature demonstrates that moral convictions guide many of our thoughts, behaviors, and social interactions. Yet, we know little about how these moral convictions come to exist. In the present research we explore moralization—the process by which something that was morally neutral takes on moral properties—examining what factors facilitate and deter it. In 3 longitudinal studies participants were presented with morally evocative stimuli about why eating meat should be viewed as a moral issue. Study 1 tracked students over a semester as they took a university course that highlighted the suffering animals endure because of human meat consumption. In Studies 2 and 3 participants took part in a mini-course we developed which presented evocative videos aimed at inducing moralization. In all 3 studies, we assessed participants’ beliefs, attitudes, emotions, and cognitions at multiple time points to track moral changes and potential factors responsible for such changes. A variety of factors, both cognitive and affective, predicted participants’ moralization or lack thereof. Model testing further pointed to two primary conduits of moralization: the experience of moral emotions (e.g., disgust, guilt) felt when contemplating the issue, and moral piggybacking (connecting the issue at hand with one’s existing fundamental moral principles). Moreover, we found individual differences, such as how much one holds their morality as central to their identity, also predicted the moralization process. We discuss the broad theoretical and applied implications of our results.

In this study, we investigated the influence of cognitive and metacognitive inter-individual differences on recall and on critical evaluation of new scientific information that was presented in a journalistic article. Sixty-three participants (80 % female; mean age 24.1 ± 3.3 years) read a newspaper article reporting research findings on a recently developed and yet unproven treatment for depression. We found that more sophisticated, domain-specific epistemological beliefs and a higher cognitive ability were independently associated with better recall of content from the article. Additionally, participants with more sophisticated epistemological beliefs displayed a more critical evaluation of the article. Cognitive ability was unrelated to critical evaluation and to epistemological beliefs. There were also no interaction effects of cognitive ability and epistemological beliefs on recall or on critical evaluation. Based on our preliminary findings and previous evidence of epistemological beliefs as a modifiable feature, we discuss this inter-individual characteristic as a potential target for the promotion of better understanding of scientific topics by the general public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Feinkohl","given":"Insa"},{"family":"Flemming","given":"Danny"},{"family":"Cress","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Kimmerle","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"feinkohlImpactEpistemologicalBeliefs2016","container-title":"Cognitive Processing","container-title-short":"Cogn Process","DOI":"10.1007/s10339-015-0748-z","ISSN":"1612-4790","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"213-223","source":"Springer Link","title":"The impact of epistemological beliefs and cognitive ability on recall and critical evaluation of scientific information","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-015-0748-z","volume":"17"},

We aim at investigating the effect of the announced attitude of a Catholic institution concerning climate protection efforts, of people’s experimentally induced religiosity (using a priming intervention) and of the corresponding interaction on people’s willingness to donate to a carbon-offsetting fund. Our results suggest that the supporting signal by the Catholic institution substantially increases donations by about 56 %. We observe neither a direct effect of the induced religiosity nor an interaction with the institution’s signal. Our results thus indicate that religious authorities can promote sustainable behavior. As we observe no evidence that the signal mainly influences particularly religious people, we further conclude that religious institutions may serve as more general authorities when it comes to sustainable behavior rather than solely as leaders of those aiming to follow religious prescripts.","author":[{"family":"Feldhaus","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Gleue","given":"Marvin"},{"family":"Löschel","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"feldhausCanReligiousInstitutions","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Can religious institutions promote sustainable behavior?

It focuses on contexts where the goal of science communication is helping people to make autonomous choices rather than promoting specific behaviors (e.g., voter turnout, vaccination rates, energy consumption).

  {"id":"fischhoffScienceScienceCommunication2014","abstract":"A puzzling world confronts scientists today. On the one hand, the fruits of science and technology are everywhere, providing health and prosperity that were unimaginable a century ago. In the United States, federal funding for science is far beyond any reasonable extrapolation of the US$120 million per year proposed by Bush (1) (for the nascent National Research Foundation). International collaboration on a grand scale can be seen in European Center for Nuclear Research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and European Union projects that help to bind the continent.\n\nOn the other hand, worrying minorities of the general public reject conclusions that are widely accepted in the scientific community, such as the advisability of childhood immunization, the foundational role of evolution in biology, and the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Whole sciences find themselves in political cross-hairs (e.g., stem cell research in some jurisdictions, social sciences periodically at the National Science Foundation, genetically modified crops in large parts of Europe).\n\nBetter science communication is key to reconciling these puzzling trends. Better communication to the public and policy makers can help scientists send clearer signals regarding the accomplishments, promises, and uncertainties of their work. Better communication from the public and policy makers can provide scientists with clearer signals regarding the public’s concerns and science’s role in addressing them. The result would be a more productive dialogue about the science and the political, social, and moral implications of its application.\n\nBecause communication is central to everyday life, people have intuitive theories about how to make themselves understood and how to interpret what others say. However, communications about science can take such generally useful strategies beyond their range of validity. Communications about science often involve unfamiliar audiences, intricate social dynamics, and complex topics, and lack the direct interactions (and feedback) needed to identify … \n\n[↵][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

  {"id":"fiskeGainingTrustWell2014","abstract":"Expertise is a prerequisite for communicator credibility, entailing the knowledge and ability to be accurate. Trust also is essential to communicator credibility. Audiences view trustworthiness as the motivation to be truthful. Identifying whom to trust follows systematic principles. People decide quickly another’s apparent intent: Who is friend or foe, on their side or not, or a cooperator or competitor. Those seemingly on their side are deemed warm (friendly, trustworthy). People then decide whether the other is competent to enact those intents. Perception of scientists, like other social perceptions, involves inferring both their apparent intent (warmth) and capability (competence). To illustrate, we polled adults online about typical American jobs, rated as American society views them, on warmth and competence dimensions, as well as relevant emotions. Ambivalently perceived high-competence but low-warmth, “envied” professions included lawyers, chief executive officers, engineers, accountants, scientists, and researchers. Being seen as competent but cold might not seem problematic until one recalls that communicator credibility requires not just status and expertise but also trustworthiness (warmth). Other research indicates the risk from being enviable. Turning to a case study of scientific communication, another online sample of adults described public attitudes toward climate scientists specifically. Although distrust is low, the apparent motive to gain research money is distrusted. The literature on climate science communicators agrees that the public trusts impartiality, not persuasive agendas. Overall, communicator credibility needs to address both expertise and trustworthiness. Scientists have earned audiences’ respect, but not necessarily their trust. Discussing, teaching, and sharing information can earn trust to show scientists’ trustworthy intentions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fiske","given":"Susan T."},{"family":"Dupree","given":"Cydney"}],"citation-key":"fiskeGainingTrustWell2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1317505111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"Supplement 4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,16]]},"language":"en","page":"13593-13597","PMID":"25225372","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Colloquium Paper","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Gaining trust as well as respect in communicating to motivated audiences about science topics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_4/13593","volume":"111"},

Generality across place, levels, and time further support the framework. Similar dimensions have emerged repeatedly over the history of psychology and in current theories. The SCM proposes and tests a comprehensive causal theory: Perceived social structure (cooperation, status) predicts stereotypes (warmth, competence), which in turn predict emotional prejudices (pride, pity, contempt, envy), and finally, the emotions predict discrimination (active and passive help and harm).

People are not entitled to harm innocents or to impose deadly risks on others, so in these cases there is nothing to be said for the right to refuse vaccination. Compulsory vaccination is therefore justified because non-vaccination can rightly be prohibited, just as other kinds of harmful and risky conduct are rightly prohibited. I develop an analogy to random gunfire to illustrate this point. Vaccine refusal, I argue, is morally similar to firing a weapon into the air and endangering innocent bystanders. By re-framing vaccine refusal as harmful and reckless conduct my aim is to shift the focus of the vaccine debate from non-vaccinators’ religious and refusal rights to everyone else’s rights against being infected with contagious illnesses. Religious freedom and rights of informed consent do not entitle non-vaccinators to harm innocent bystanders, and so coercive vaccination requirements are permissible for the sake of the potential victims of the anti-vaccine movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Flanigan","given":"Jessica"}],"citation-key":"flaniganDefenseCompulsoryVaccination2014","container-title":"HEC Forum","container-title-short":"HEC Forum","DOI":"10/ghspjv","ISSN":"1572-8498","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"5-25","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Defense of Compulsory Vaccination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10730-013-9221-5","volume":"26"},

Being able to drink huge amounts of alcohol is a celebrated male athletic virtue. Ridicule and often exclusion is reserved for those who are unable to conform to this. Ritualized drinking is not, and cannot, be enjoyed by all. British Muslims (the majority of whom are of South Asian descent) for instance, are restricted from drinking alcohol due to the demands of Islam. This paper uses data collected from ethnographic research conducted with white British and British Pakistani Muslim cricketers to locate the significance of drinking alcohol in both the inclusion and exclusion of British Pakistani Muslims.

Within the framework of the cognitive science of religion, this article reviews experimental evidence supporting human predisposition for religious thinking and focuses on the hypothesis that a reason why religious beliefs are successful is their minimal counterintuitiveness. According to this hypothesis, religious concepts or stories would be characterized by containing only a small number of world-knowledge violations, which attracts attention while improving memorizability. We conclude this review by summarizing recent findings from our group using brain electrical activity and delving further into these questions.

Both behavioral and electrophysiological results converged. At variance to the literal interpretation of the sentences, the induced metaphorical interpretation specifically facilitated the integration (N400 amplitude decrease) of religious counterintuitions, whereas the semantic processing of non-religious counterintuitions was not affected by the interpretation mode.

These established findings have been confirmed in the present study employing the Astley- Francis Scale of Attitude toward Theistic Faith as a measure of explicit religion. Moreover, the new data also demonstrate that scientific fundamentalism conceptualised as implicit religion has a positive effect on both self-esteem and empathy, although this effect is somewhat smaller.

Blockwise multiple regression demonstrated that personal, psychological, religious, and theological factors all held significant power, but that the greatest variance was explained by the attitudinal variables. When the five sets of variables were assessed within the model, 25% of the variance was accounted for.

  {"id":"franksMonologicalityExploringConspiracist2017","abstract":"Conspiracy theories (CTs) are widespread ways by which people make sense of unsettling or disturbing cultural events. Belief in CTs is often connected to problematic consequences, such as decreased engagement with conventional political action or even political extremism, so understanding the psychological and social qualities of CTs belief is important. CTs have often been understood to be “monological”, displaying the tendency for belief in one conspiracy theory to be correlated with belief in (many) others. Explanations of monologicality invoke a nomothetical or “closed” mindset whereby mutually supporting beliefs based on mistrust of official explanations are used to interpret public events as conspiracies, independent of the facts about those events (which they may ignore or deny). But research on monologicality offers little discussion of the content of monological beliefs and reasoning from the standpoint of the CT believers. This is due in part to the “access problem” (Wood & Douglas, 2015): CT believers are averse to being researched because they often distrust researchers and what they appear to represent. We used several strategies to address the access problem, and investigated the symbolic resources underlying CTs by reconstructing a conspiracy worldview - a set of beliefs held by CT believers about important dimensions of ontology, epistemology, and human agency. To do this, we analysed media documents, conducted field observation, and engaged in semi-structured interviews,. We describe six main dimensions of a conspiracy worldview: Views of the nature of reality, the self, the outgroup, the ingroup, action, and the future. We also describe a typology of five types of CT believers, which vary according to their positions on each of these dimensions. Our findings converge with prior explorations of CT beliefs but also revealed novel aspects: A sense of community among CT believers, a highly differentiated representation of the outgroup, a personal journey of conversion, variegated kinds of political action, and optimistic belief in future change. These findings are at odds with the typical image of monological CT believers as paranoid, cynical, anomic and irrational. For many, the CT worldview may rather constitute the ideological underpinning of a nascent pre-figurative social movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Franks","given":"Bradley"},{"family":"Bangerter","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Martin W."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Noort","given":"Mark C."}],"citation-key":"franksMonologicalityExploringConspiracist2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"freemanCoronavirusConspiracyBeliefsundefined/ed","abstract":"BackgroundAn invisible threat has visibly altered the world. Governments and key institutions have had to implement decisive responses to the danger posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Imposed change will increase the likelihood that alternative explanations take hold. In a proportion of the general population there may be strong scepticism, fear of being misled, and false conspiracy theories. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of conspiracy thinking about the pandemic and test associations with reduced adherence to government guidelines.MethodsA non-probability online survey with 2501 adults in England, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, income, and region.ResultsApproximately 50% of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25% showed a degree of endorsement, 15% showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10% had very high levels of endorsement. Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated. Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions.

Using ethnographic approach, data were collected through in-depth interviews with 26 female liqo members from a total of 45 interviewees and 15 observations of the liqo sessions. The study concludes that although the official form of religiosity, piety and political identity have been promoted by the Tarbiyah movement and its leaders, the experiences and practices of women revealed a heterogeneity and complexity of meanings of being in the liqo.

  {"id":"fuchsFraudTrustScience1996","abstract":"FRAUD AND TRUST IN SCIENCE STEPHAN FUCHS and SAUNDRA DAVIS WESTERVELT* It is more ignominious to mistrust than to be deceived.—La Rochefoucauld Two Forms of Scientific Deviance \"Deviance in science\" should be, and often is, separated from \"scientific deviance.\" The former is much more frequent than the latter [1, p.552]. Deviance in science includes all behaviors and communications that violate established law or other social conventions, such as sexual harassment or the improper handling of research funds. Modern science is a work organization, and as such subject to similar rules and regulations as govern other work organizations. As opposed to this very broad category, we understand \"scientific deviance\" to refer to misconduct in the act of doing science. We deal only with scientific deviance or misconduct, not with deviance in science. Following Zuckerman [2, p.521], we distinguish here two common forms of scientific deviance, fraud and plagiarism. There are many contested , ambiguous, and changing definitions for both. Various agencies and institutions define and interpret \"misconduct\" in different ways. However, the main problem seems to be how to demarcate fraud and plagiarism from other \"deviant\" research practices—such as divergent interpretations, error, sloppiness, selective presentation of data, or innovations . One popular way to distinguish scientific misconduct from other The authors thank the Biology Department at the University of Virginia, and especially Bob Kretzinger, for providing the medium within which this argument was first presented. Special thanks are due Paul Gross, whose most generous support was critical for completing this project. *Department of Sociology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903.©1995 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved. 0031-5982/95/3901-0942$01.00 248 Fuchs and Westervelt ¦ Fraud and Trust in Science deviance, with precedents in law, is by the intention to deceive [3-5]. While not all relevant agencies have adopted this practice, it is nevertheless influential, and colors even definitions that do not explicitly require the intention to deceive before establishing fraud. For example, the federal Office of Research Integrity (ORI) will have to establish intent to deceive in the highly publicized Imanishi-Kari case to overrule her appeal of ORI's guilty verdict [6]. As of September 1993, the ORI, probably the foremost judicial authority on misconduct, stated that misconduct \"does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data\" [7, p.2]. This modification was in response to the criticism that the previous definition of misconduct— \"fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scientific community \"—gave too much room for accusations against innovative science. The importance of intent is also indirectly stressed in the definition of misconduct given by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS): \"Misconduct in science does not include errors of judgment; errors in the recording, selection, or analysis of data; differences in opinions involving the interpretation of data; or misconduct unrelated to the research process\" [8, p.5]. Even the National Science Foundation's (NSF) definition of misconduct—which still includes the phrase \"serious deviations from accepted research practices\"—emphasizes intent, insofar as \"ordinary errors\" and \"ordinary differences in interpretations orjudgements of data\" are not \"considered to be misconduct under this definition\" [4, p.290]. The NSF also cautions that its definition of misconduct does not endorse an \"interpretation that would make it misconduct in science just to do something novel or unorthodox\" [9, p.647]. Intent to deceive, then, appears significant in most understandings and definitions of fraud, even if it is not included expressis verbis. We define \"fraud,\" then, as the deliberate fabrication or falsification of evidence with the intention to deceive or misinform peers and other audiences of scientific knowledge. In addition, some, but not all, definitions now require that falsifications and fabrications have a \"significant effect\" on the research and its results [10, H]. This shows that what is sometimes considered decisive is not falsification or fabrication per se, but only insofar and inasmuch as it influences what is eventually communicated to others. That is, the emphasis is on communication, not action. \"Plagiarism\" is the intentional failure to credit known others for some idea, invention, or discovery. Plagiarism is theft of intellectual...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Westervelt","given":"Saundra Davis"}],"citation-key":"fuchsFraudTrustScience1996","container-title":"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1353/pbm.1996.0043","ISSN":"1529-8795","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"page":"248-269","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Fraud and Trust in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/401208","volume":"39"},

This paper sets out to further our understanding of science skepticism and to inform both academic research and policymaking. Departing from a review of the academic literature on conceptualizations of science skepticism, we employ Eurobarometer 2021 data to explore the characteristics of people holding skeptical attitudes concerning climate change and evolution. Replicating prior findings, we observe minor variations across sociodemographic characteristics. Moreover, science skepticism relates to general science attitudes in a nonuniform manner within and across issues, and interest in and engagement with science are nonuniformly related to skepticism. Furthermore, science skepticism is inconsistent in its relationship to both attitudes and relationships with science across contexts. Based on the heterogeneous nature of skepticism(s), we argue that research and policy should be careful in approaching science skepticism as a general negative predisposition toward science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuglsang","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Losi","given":"Lucilla"}],"citation-key":"fuglsangScienceSkepticismReally2024","container-title":"Science and Public Policy","container-title-short":"Sci.

This study examines relationships of students’ attitudes toward science with their perceptions of science as inclusive or non-religious, and their epistemological beliefs about epistemic authority and certainty. Data were collected using an online survey system among undergraduates at a large, public US university (n = 582). Data were prepared using a Rasch rating scale model and then analyzed using multiple-regression analysis. Gender and number of science and mathematics courses were included as control variables, followed by perceptions of science, then epistemological beliefs. Findings show that respondents have more positive attitudes when they perceive science to be inclusive of women and minorities, and when they perceive science to be incompatible with religion. Respondents also have more positive attitudes toward science when they believe scientific knowledge is uncertain, and when they believe knowledge derives from authority.

Results indicate that participants in the study saw the relationship between science and religious belief in ways unforeseen and unappreciated by traditional school science programs. The stories of selected participants are told and they frame a discussion of implications of the study for science teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fysh","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Keith B."}],"citation-key":"fyshReligiousBeliefsScience1998","container-title":"Research in Science Education","container-title-short":"Research in Science Education","DOI":"10.1007/BF02461507","ISSN":"0157-244X, 1573-1898","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",12]]},"language":"en","page":"399-427","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Religious beliefs in science classrooms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF02461507","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"galenOverlappingMentalMagisteria2017","abstract":"Subjective religious and spiritual experiences (rs) are believed by many to be reliable indicators of external agency. A set of related phenomena are used to support this view that typically involve intuitions or attributions of mental interaction or experiences with rs agents. The present review integrates empirical findings from the fields of the Cognitive Sciences of Religion, experimental social psychology, and neuropsychology to support the position that individuals misattribute rs thoughts and experiences. That is, these experiences are believed to be veridical indicators of external agency when in fact they are subject to materialistic causal influences. This tendency varies as a function of individual differences and contextual conditions. rs phenomena can be artificially generated in a way that is phenomenologically indistinguishable from spontaneous experiences. Intuitions of external agency are rationalized and confabulated, leaving the mistaken impression of validation by analytic processes. The theoretical and philosophical implications of findings are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Galen","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"galenOverlappingMentalMagisteria2017","container-title":"Method & Theory in the Study of Religion","DOI":"10.1163/15700682-12341393","ISSN":"0943-3058, 1570-0682","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,28]]},"language":"en","page":"221-267","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill-com.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de","title":"Overlapping Mental Magisteria: Implications of Experimental Psychology for a Theory of Religious Belief as Misattribution","title-short":"Overlapping Mental Magisteria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/mtsr/29/3/article-p221_2.xml","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"galenTestingReligionSpiritualitymental2024","abstract":"Findings from the recent Many-Analysts Religion Project (MARP) have been characterized as supporting a robust positive relationship between various measures of religion and aspects of well-being. However different conceptualizations of religiosity (e.g. identity, attendance, belief, conviction) can theoretically be expected to display distinct (e.g. non-linear or curvilinear) patterns of relationships with different manifestations of well-being. Additionally extant analyses of MARP data have not addressed how influences such as social support affect the relationship between religion/spirituality (R/S) and well-being. The present analysis restricted to a subset of countries with the predominant religion of Christianity found that net demographic controls, meaning in life, and enjoyment of life was significantly higher among those identifying as religious, attending religious service, and identifying as believing in God. However, when God was modelled quadratically, both meaning in life and enjoyment of life demonstrated a “J-shaped” relationship, although the nuances for their interpretation were distinct. Thus, partial support was found for a quadradic or “J-shaped” relationship between religious belief and mental well-being. Finally, adjusting estimates for social support tended to diminish the importance of R/S variables for predicting well-being, suggesting that increased well-being evinces a complex relationship with religious belief.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Galen","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Speed","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"galenTestingReligionSpiritualitymental2024","container-title":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/2153599X.2024.2378992","ISSN":"2153-599X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"page":"1-18","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Testing the religion/spirituality-mental health curvilinear hypothesis using data from many-analysts religion project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2024.2378992","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"garrettEpistemicBeliefsRole2017","abstract":"Widespread misperceptions undermine citizens’ decision-making ability. Conclusions based on falsehoods and conspiracy theories are by definition flawed. This article demonstrates that individuals’ epistemic beliefs–beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how one comes to know–have important implications for perception accuracy. The present study uses a series of large, nationally representative surveys of the U.S. population to produce valid and reliable measures of three aspects of epistemic beliefs: reliance on intuition for factual beliefs (Faith in Intuition for facts), importance of consistency between empirical evidence and beliefs (Need for evidence), and conviction that “facts” are politically constructed (Truth is political). Analyses confirm that these factors complement established predictors of misperception, substantively increasing our ability to explain both individuals’ propensity to engage in conspiracist ideation, and their willingness to embrace falsehoods about high-profile scientific and political issues. Individuals who view reality as a political construct are significantly more likely to embrace falsehoods, whereas those who believe that their conclusions must hew to available evidence tend to hold more accurate beliefs. Confidence in the ability to intuitively recognize truth is a uniquely important predictor of conspiracist ideation. Results suggest that efforts to counter misperceptions may be helped by promoting epistemic beliefs emphasizing the importance of evidence, cautious use of feelings, and trust that rigorous assessment by knowledgeable specialists is an effective guard against political manipulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Garrett","given":"R.

  {"id":"garrouttePositivistAttackBaconian2003","abstract":"This chapter examines how a group of science activists advanced a religiously hostile positivist discourse to supersede the dominant Baconian scientific practice. The primary goal of Baconian science was to accumulate facts through refined observation. Baconian philosophy set up a permeable boundary between discourses. Science was an activity of worship, and religion the product of reasoning and verification. Users of religious symbols discussed nature, while scientific speakers were prevented from securing authority in those discussions. The chapter focuses on the discursive struggles recorded in the scientific journals most responsible for the advance of positivism. Furthermore, it reveals that the secularization of science was a strategic achievement of interested activists, not an automatic, natural process of differentiation or rationalization. Finally, the chapter examines the assumptions underpinning the Baconian model of science, and considers the discursive assaults upon it by positivist activists, which eventually led to its collapse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"citation-key":"garrouttePositivistAttackBaconian2003","collection-editor":[{"family":"Garroutte","given":"Eva Marie"}],"container-title":"The Secular Revolution","DOI":"10.1525/california/9780520230002.003.0004","ISBN":"978-0-520-23000-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"University Press Scholarship","title":"The Positivist Attack on Baconian Science and Religious Knowledge in the 1870s","type":"chapter","URL":"https://california.universitypressscholarship.com/10.1525/california/9780520230002.001.0001/upso-9780520230002-chapter-4"},

  {"id":"gauchatCulturalAuthorityScience2011","abstract":"Using the National Science Foundation’s 2006 Science Indicators Survey, this study explores three distinct explanations of public attitudes. First, the knowledge–attitudes model refers to a well tested relationship between public knowledge of science and more favorable attitudes toward science. Second, the alienation model hypothesizes that public disassociation with science is a symptom of a general disenchantment with late modernity, mainly, the limitations associated with codified expertise, rational bureaucracy, and institutional authority. A third approach emphasizes the cultural meaning of science: how various public beliefs about “what science is” relate to acceptance or reservations about science. The Science Indicators Survey shows that US adults view science (what it is or should be) in three distinct ways: 1) in terms of having a systematic method, 2) in terms of social location (i.e., takes place in a university or a laboratory), and 3) in terms of knowledge that should accord with commonsense and tradition. The findings in this study indicate that the knowledge–attitudes, alienation, and cultural meanings models are all valuable for understanding the cultural authority of science. However, the strength of these explanations depends on the type of attitude analyzed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gauchat","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"gauchatCulturalAuthorityScience2011","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662510365246","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"751-770","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The cultural authority of science: Public trust and acceptance of organized science","title-short":"The cultural authority of science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662510365246","volume":"20"},

Using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey, I examine group differences in trust in science and group-specific change in these attitudes over time. Results show that group differences in trust in science are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the lowest. The patterns for science are also unique when compared to public trust in other secular institutions. Results show enduring differences in trust in science by social class, ethnicity, gender, church attendance, and region.

  {"id":"geertzWhenCognitiveScientists2009","abstract":"Since the 1990s medical technology has afforded exciting possibilities for studying the brain. Together with knowledge accrued through psychology and psychiatry, it has set the stage for pioneering research and stimulated disciplines such as Social Neuroscience, the Cognitive Science of Religion, Cognitive Anthropology, and Cognitive Archaeology. Another discipline has arisen, Neurotheology, which is interested in the brain and religious experience. Early proponents such as d’Aquili and Newberg had a religious agenda in their work. Others, such as members of Transcendental Meditation, have used experimental and brain studies to legitimate religious agendas. Experiential shamanists have embarked on a similar legitimation process. The differences between science and therapy and spirituality have been blurred or denied. Neurotheological attempts to discover areas of the brain responsible for religious experiences have led to untenable results. The fact that such research has passed the peer review process of leading psychological, psychiatric, and neurological journals is perhaps more indicative of the pervasiveness of religiosity throughout American society than of objective brain science. This essay argues that neurotheology is an example of the struggle between confessional and critical approaches to the study of religion. The main difference is that the battlefield of this struggle is the brain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Geertz","given":"Armin W."}],"citation-key":"geertzWhenCognitiveScientists2009","container-title":"Religion","DOI":"10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.001","ISSN":"0048-721X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"page":"319-324","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"When cognitive scientists become religious, science is in trouble: On neurotheology from a philosophy of science perspective","title-short":"When cognitive scientists become religious, science is in trouble","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.001","volume":"39"},

The resulting climate skepticism has derailed discussions to address the issue collectively in the United States. To counteract these social consistency pressures, we developed a cognitive consistency intervention for climate skeptics. We first demonstrated that most people share substantial faith in a variety of scientific findings, across disciplines ranging from medicine to astronomy. Next, we showed that conservative participants who first acknowledged several general contributions of science subsequently reported significantly stronger beliefs in climate science (as compared to conservatives who were asked only about their climate science beliefs).

In the present study, we extend this previous work into a domain wrought with inferred communicator biases, policy advocacy. Competence and character enhancing source factors, expertise, perceived caring, and salient value similarity are manipulated to assess their impact on one’s likelihood to support a policy advocated by the source. Results from this online experiment (N = 397) suggest that a climate change policy advocate increased policy support when the advocate was described as (a) caring about people like the participant (vs. not caring) and (b) sharing the participants’ salient values for environmental protection (vs. not sharing their salient values). In contrast, policy support was not influenced by information about the advocate’s expertise. These findings provide initial evidence that communication efforts may need to consider source factors beyond expertise and particularly, those related to trusting one’s character when advocating climate policies.

One prominently discussed model is analytic atheism, wherein cognitive reflection, as measured with the Cognitive Reflection Test, overrides religious intuitions and instruction. Consistent with this model, performance-based measures of cognitive reflection predict religious disbelief in WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, & Democratic) samples. However, the generality of analytic atheism remains unknown. Drawing on a large global sample (N = 3461) from 13 religiously, demographically, and culturally diverse societies, we find that analytic atheism as usually assessed is in fact quite fickle cross-culturally, appearing robustly only in aggregate analyses and in three individual countries. The results provide additional evidence for culture’s effects on core beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gervais","given":"Will M."},{"family":"Elk","given":"Michiel","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Xygalatas","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"McKay","given":"Ryan T."},{"family":"Aveyard","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Buchtel","given":"Emma E."},{"family":"Dar-Nimrod","given":"Ilan"},{"family":"Klocová","given":"Eva Kundtová"},{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Jonathan E."},{"family":"Riekki","given":"Tapani"},{"family":"Svedholm-Häkkinen","given":"Annika M."},{"family":"Bulbulia","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"gervaisAnalyticAtheismCrossculturally2018","container-title":"Judgment and Decision Making","DOI":"10.1017/S1930297500007701","ISSN":"1930-2975","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"268-274","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Analytic atheism: A cross-culturally weak and fickle phenomenon?","title-short":"Analytic atheism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/analytic-atheism-a-crossculturally-weak-and-fickle-phenomenon/A5FFB887C2215A654186B799208EE529","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"gervaisAnalyticThinkingPromotes2012","abstract":"Scientific interest in the cognitive underpinnings of religious belief has grown in recent years. However, to date, little experimental research has focused on the cognitive processes that may promote religious disbelief. The present studies apply a dual-process model of cognitive processing to this problem, testing the hypothesis that analytic processing promotes religious disbelief. Individual differences in the tendency to analytically override initially flawed intuitions in reasoning were associated with increased religious disbelief. Four additional experiments provided evidence of causation, as subtle manipulations known to trigger analytic processing also encouraged religious disbelief. Combined, these studies indicate that analytic processing is one factor (presumably among several) that promotes religious disbelief. Although these findings do not speak directly to conversations about the inherent rationality, value, or truth of religious beliefs, they illuminate one cognitive factor that may influence such discussions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gervais","given":"Will M."},{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"}],"citation-key":"gervaisAnalyticThinkingPromotes2012","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1215647","issue":"6080","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,27]]},"page":"493-496","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"www-science-org.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de (Atypon)","title":"Analytic Thinking Promotes Religious Disbelief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1215647","volume":"336"},

In support of our first hypothesis, we found a negative relationship between reflective thinking and BiG; and in support of our second hypothesis, we found a positive relationship between intuitive thinking and BiG. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that measuring CRT prior to measuring BiG decreased BiG. Given that this is the first large cross-cultural test of these hypotheses to have a preregistered analysis plan, the first to hold education constant across countries, and the first to use both Bayesian and frequentist methods, these results considerably bolster the evidence in support of the first two hypotheses and against the third hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghasemi","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Onurcan"},{"family":"Isler","given":"Ozan"},{"family":"Terry","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"ghasemiReflectiveThinkingPredicts2025","container-title":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review","container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-025-02691-9","ISSN":"1531-5320","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,24]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Reflective thinking predicts disbelief in God across 19 countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-025-02691-9"},
  {"id":"ghufronKnowledgeLearningInterreligious2020","abstract":"Epistemological beliefs are the basis of how someone acquires knowledge and are used as a guide for behavior in everyday life. For religious fundamentalists, however, their belief in religious knowledge is very strong, causing them to negate different opinions and ideas. Since the radicalization process is closely related to the education process, two important epistemological concepts of belief about knowledge and belief about learning need to be tested to analyze the extent to which these two factors might be predictors of an individual’s tendency towards religious fundamentalism. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of epistemological beliefs on the religious fundamentalism of Muslim millennial youth. By using a simple random sampling method, data collection was conducted by distributing Likert-scale questionnaires to 195 Muslim undergraduate students at an Islamic institute in Kudus, Central Java. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results showed that the proposed model was appropriate and eligible for hypothesis testing (p = 138, goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.965, adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) = 0.934, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) = 0.978 and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.040). Furthermore, statistical analysis shows that epistemological beliefs in the form of beliefs about knowledge (critical ratio (C.R) = 4585 and p = 0.000) and beliefs about learning (C.R = 3202 and p = 0.001) have significant and positive effects on religious fundamentalism. These results highlight the importance of developing the concept of critical thinking in learning and inclusiveness-oriented education to eradicate religious fundamentalism among millennials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghufron","given":"M.

  {"id":"giambiParentalVaccineHesitancy2018","abstract":"In Italy, in 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate vaccine hesitancy and investigate its determinants among parents of children aged 16–36 months. Data on parental attitudes and beliefs about vaccinations were collected through a questionnaire administered online or self-administered at pediatricians’ offices and nurseries. Parents were classified as pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant or anti-vaccine, according to self-reported tetanus and measles vaccination status of their child. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with hesitancy. A total of 3130 questionnaires were analysed: 83.7% of parents were pro-vaccine, 15.6% vaccine-hesitant and 0.7% anti-vaccine. Safety concerns are the main reported reason for refusing (38.1%) or interrupting (42.4%) vaccination. Anti-vaccine and hesitant parents are significantly more afraid than pro-vaccine parents of short-term (85.7 and 79.7% vs 60.4%) and long-term (95.2 and 72.3% vs 43.7%) vaccine adverse reactions. Most pro-vaccine and hesitant parents agree about the benefits of vaccinations. Family pediatricians are considered a reliable source of information by most pro-vaccine and hesitant parents (96.9 and 83.3% respectively), against 45% of anti-vaccine parents. The main factors associated with hesitancy were found to be: not having received from a paediatrician a recommendation to fully vaccinate their child [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.21, 95% CI: 2.14–4.79], having received discordant opinions on vaccinations (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.11–2.43), having met parents of children who experienced serious adverse reactions (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03–2.15), and mainly using non-traditional medical treatments (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.31–3.19). Vaccine safety is perceived as a concern by all parents, although more so by hesitant and anti-vaccine parents. Similarly to pro-vaccine parents, hesitant parents consider vaccination an important prevention tool and trust their family pediatricians, suggesting that they could benefit from appropriate communication interventions. Training health professionals and providing homogenous information about vaccinations, in line with national recommendations, are crucial for responding to their concerns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Giambi","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Fabiani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"D'Ancona","given":"Fortunato"},{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Lorenza"},{"family":"Fiacchini","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gallo","given":"Tolinda"},{"family":"Martinelli","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Pascucci","given":"Maria Grazia"},{"family":"Prato","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Filia","given":"Antonietta"},{"family":"Bella","given":"Antonino"},{"family":"Del Manso","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Rizzo","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Rota","given":"Maria Cristina"}],"citation-key":"giambiParentalVaccineHesitancy2018","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.074","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"779-787","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Parental vaccine hesitancy in Italy – Results from a national survey","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17318376","volume":"36"},

Therefore, two exploratory studies were performed to investigate the effects of science-critical user comments attacking Facebook posts containing scientific claims. The claims were about one of four controversial topics (homeopathy, genetically modified organisms, refugee crime, and childhood vaccinations). The user comments attacked the claims based on the thematic complexity, the employed research methods, the expertise, or the motivations of the researchers. The results reveal that prior attitudes determine judgments about the user comments, the attacked claims, and the source of the claim. After controlling for attitude, people agree most with thematic complexity comments, but the comments differ in their effect on perceived claim credibility only when the comments are made by experts. In addition, comments attacking researchers? motivations were more effective in lowering perceived integrity while scientists? perceived expertise remained unaffected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gierth","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"gierthAttackingScienceSocial2020","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662519889275","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"230-247","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Attacking science on social media: How user comments affect perceived trustworthiness and credibility","title-short":"Attacking science on social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662519889275","volume":"29"},

This is true even in the case of claims regarding controversial science topics, such as anthropogenic climate change (Study 3). In contrast, the decision to forgo further inquiry is taken to signal greater commitment to religion, but only when the claim under consideration contains religious content (Study 1–3).

Contrary to what some have claimed, we argue that this individual moral obligation exists in spite of the fact that each individual vaccination does not significantly affect vaccination coverage rates and therefore does not significantly contribute to herd immunity. Establishing the existence of a moral obligation to be vaccinated (both for adults and for children) despite the negligible contribution each vaccination can make to the realisation of herd immunity is important because such moral obligation would strengthen the justification for coercive vaccination policies. We show that two types of arguments—namely a utilitarian argument based on Parfit’s Principle of Group Beneficence and a contractualist argument—can ground an individual moral obligation to be vaccinated, in spite of the imperceptible contribution that any single vaccination makes to vaccine coverage rates. We add a further argument for a moral obligation to be vaccinated that does not require embracing problematic comprehensive moral theories such as utilitarianism or contractualism. The argument is based on a “duty of easy rescue” applied to collectives, which grounds a collective moral obligation to realise herd immunity, and on a principle of fairness in the distribution of the burdens that must be borne to realise herd immunity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Giubilini","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Savulescu","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"giubiliniMoralObligationBe2018","container-title":"Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy","container-title-short":"Med Health Care and Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s11019-018-9829-y","ISSN":"1572-8633","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"547-560","source":"Springer Link","title":"The moral obligation to be vaccinated: utilitarianism, contractualism, and collective easy rescue","title-short":"The moral obligation to be vaccinated","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-018-9829-y","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"glennanWhoseScienceWhose2009","abstract":"Arguments about the relationship between science and religion often proceed by identifying a set of essential characteristics of scientific and religious worldviews and arguing on the basis of these characteristics for claims about a relationship of conflict or compatibility between them. Such a strategy is doomed to failure because science, to some extent, and religion, to a much larger extent, are cultural phenomena that are too diverse in their expressions to be characterized in terms of a unified worldview. In this paper I follow a different strategy. Having offered a loose characterization of the nature of science, I pose five questions about specific areas where religious and scientific worldviews may conflict—questions about the nature of faith, the belief in a God or Gods, the authority of sacred texts, the relationship between scientific and religious conceptions of the mind/soul, and the relationship between scientific and religious understandings of moral behavior. My review of these questions will show that they cannot be answered unequivocally because there is no agreement amongst religious believers as to the meaning of important religious concepts. Thus, whether scientific and religious worldviews conflict depends essentially upon whose science and whose religion one is considering. In closing, I consider the implications of this conundrum for science education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Glennan","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"glennanWhoseScienceWhose2009","container-title":"Science, Worldviews and Education","DOI":"10.1007/978-90-481-2779-5_8","editor":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"Michael R."}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-90-481-2779-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"149-164","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Whose Science and Whose Religion?

Key to capitalizing on such solutions is the public’s trust and willingness to grant influence to scientists in shaping policy. However, previous research on determinants of trust is limited and does not factor in the diversity of scientific occupations. The present study (N = 2,780; U.S. participants) investigated how four well-established dimensions of social evaluations (competence, assertiveness, morality, warmth) shape trust in 45 types of scientists (from agronomists to zoologists). Trust in most scientists was relatively high but varied considerably across occupations. Perceptions of morality and competence emerged as the most important antecedents of trust, in turn predicting the willingness to grant scientists influence in managing societal problems. Importantly, the contribution of morality (but not competence) varied across occupations: Morality was most strongly associated with trust in scientists who work on contentious and polarized issues (e.g., climatologists). Therefore, the diversity of scientific occupations must be taken into account to more precisely map trust, which is important for understanding when scientific solutions find their way to policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gligorić","given":"Vukašin"},{"family":"Kleef","given":"Gerben A.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Rutjens","given":"Bastiaan T."}],"citation-key":"gligoricHowSocialEvaluations2024","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0299621","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,18]]},"language":"en","page":"e0299621","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"How social evaluations shape trust in 45 types of scientists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299621","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"golecdezavalaCollectiveNarcissismPolitical2019","abstract":"This article proposes a new theoretical framework for the reviewed state-of-the-art research on collective narcissism—the belief that the ingroup’s exceptionality is not sufficiently appreciated by others. Collective narcissism is motivated by the investment of an undermined sense of self-esteem into the belief in the ingroup’s entitlement to privilege. Collective narcissism lies in the heart of populist rhetoric. The belief in ingroup’s exceptionality compensates the undermined sense of self-worth, leaving collective narcissists hypervigilant to signs of threat to the ingroup’s position. People endorsing the collective narcissistic belief are prone to biased perceptions of intergroup situations and to conspiratorial thinking. They retaliate to imagined provocations against the ingroup but sometimes overlook real threats. They are prejudiced and hostile. Deficits in emotional regulation, hostile attribution bias, and vindictiveness lie behind the robust link between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility. Interventions that support the regulation of negative emotions, such as experiencing self-transcendent emotions, decrease the link between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility and offer further insights into the nature of collective narcissism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Golec de Zavala","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Dyduch‐Hazar","given":"Karolina"},{"family":"Lantos","given":"Dorottya"}],"citation-key":"golecdezavalaCollectiveNarcissismPolitical2019","container-title":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/pops.12569","ISSN":"0162-895X, 1467-9221","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"37-74","source":"Crossref","title":"Collective Narcissism: Political Consequences of Investing Self‐Worth in the Ingroup’s Image","title-short":"Collective Narcissism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12569","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"golovchenkoStateMediaCivil2018","abstract":"This article explores the dynamics of digital (dis)information in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. International Relations scholars have presented the online debate in terms of ‘information warfare’—that is, a number of strategic campaigns to win over local and global public opinion, largely orchestrated by the Kremlin and pro-western authorities. However, this way of describing the online debate reduces civil society to a mere target for manipulation. This article presents a different understanding of the debate. By examining the social media engagement generated by one of the conflict's most important events—the downing of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine—we explore how competing claims about the cause of the plane crash are disseminated by the state, media and civil society. By analysing approximately 950,000 tweets, the article demonstrates how individual citizens are more than purveyors of government messages; they are the most active drivers of both disinformation and attempts to counter such information. These citizen curators actively shape competing narratives about why MH17 crashed and citizens, as a group, are four times more likely to be retweeted than any other type of user. Our findings challenge conceptualizations of a state-orchestrated information war over Ukraine, and point to the importance of citizen activity in the struggle over truths during international conflicts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Golovchenko","given":"Yevgeniy"},{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Mareike"},{"family":"Adler-Nissen","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"golovchenkoStateMediaCivil2018","container-title":"International Affairs","container-title-short":"International Affairs","DOI":"10.1093/ia/iiy148","ISSN":"0020-5850","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"975-994","source":"Silverchair","title":"State, media and civil society in the information warfare over Ukraine: citizen curators of digital disinformation","title-short":"State, media and civil society in the information warfare over Ukraine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiy148","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"goodwinPsychologyMetaethicsExploring2008","abstract":"How do lay individuals think about the objectivity of their ethical beliefs? Do they regard them as factual and objective, or as more subjective and opinion-based, and what might predict such differences? In three experiments, we set out a methodology for assessing the perceived objectivity of ethical beliefs, and use it to document several novel findings. Experiment 1 showed that individuals tend to regard ethical statements as clearly more objective than social conventions and tastes, and almost as objective as scientific facts. Yet, there was considerable variation in objectivism, both across different ethical statements, and across individuals. The extent to which individuals treat ethical beliefs as objective was predicted by the way they grounded their ethical systems. Groundings which emphasize the religious, pragmatic, and self-identity underpinnings of ethical belief each independently predicted greater ethical objectivity. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings with a refined measure of ethical objectivism. Experiment 3 demonstrated the robustness of the religious grounding of ethics, and differentiates it from mere religious belief and from political orientation. The results shed light on the nature of ethical belief, and have implications for the resolution of ethical disputes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Geoffrey P."},{"family":"Darley","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"goodwinPsychologyMetaethicsExploring2008","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2007.06.007","ISSN":"0010-0277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1339-1366","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The psychology of meta-ethics: Exploring objectivism","title-short":"The psychology of meta-ethics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002770700176X","volume":"106"},

We propose that religious outgroups threaten the foundational beliefs of people with strong religious worldviews (RWVs) by endorsing alternative belief systems and that this threat contributes to religious prejudice. To examine these ideas, we developed a measure of RWV strength and assessed the role of RWV threat in religious prejudice. Across five studies, strength of RWV was related to religious prejudice, including derogation and denial of alternative religious viewpoints, as well as support for suppressing, avoiding, and even aggressing against religious outgroups. These responses were strongest toward religious outgroups whose worldviews were the most different, and therefore most threatening. Mediational analyses revealed that strong RWV people expressed heightened prejudice because of the worldview threat posed by religious outgroup members. These findings indicate that the avoidance and subjugation of religious outgroups can serve as a worldview protection strategy for some people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Goplen","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Plant","given":"E.

  {"id":"goreisSystematicReviewMetaAnalysis2019","abstract":"In the last decade, the number of investigations of the beliefs in conspiracy theories has begun to increase in the fields of social, differential, and experimental psychology. A considerable number of variables have been suggested as predictors of conspiracy beliefs, amongst them personality factors such as low agreeableness (as disagreeableness is associated with suspicion and antagonism) and high openness to experience (due to its positive association to seek out unusual and novel ideas). The association between agreeableness, openness to experience and conspiracy beliefs remains unclear in the literature. The present study reviews the literature of psychological studies investigating conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, the association between Big Five personality factors and conspiracy beliefs is analyzed meta-analytically using random-effects models. Ninety-six studies were identified for the systematic review. A comprehensive account of predictors, consequences, operationalization, questionnaires, and most prominent conspiracy theories is presented. For meta-analysis, 74 effect sizes from 13 studies were extracted. The psychological literature on predictors of conspiracy beliefs can be divided in approaches either with a pathological (e.g., paranoia) or socio-political focus (e.g., perceived powerlessness). Generally, there is a lack of theoretical frameworks in this young area of research. Meta-analysis revealed that agreeableness, openness to experience, and the remaining Big Five personality factors were not significantly associated with conspiracy beliefs if effect sizes are aggregated. Considerable heterogeneity in designs and operationalization characterizes the field. This article provides an overview of instrumentation, study designs, and current state of knowledge in an effort towards advancement and consensus in the study of conspiracy beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Goreis","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Voracek","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"goreisSystematicReviewMetaAnalysis2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Supplyside theories that focus exclusively on religious participation and membership seem too one-dimensional. But classical theories of secularization contain generalized and teleological premises that are at odds with the complexities of empirical reality and the historical record. This review seeks to map a new way forward and identify key obstacles and goals. It begins by retracing the development of secularization theory within sociology and the genealogy of the secularization concept within presociological discourse. It then reviews what is and is not known about secularization in the West, noting the limitations of the data and biases in research. The article further argues for comparative and historical approaches that incorporate non-Christian religions and non-Western regions. The social scientiﬁc literature that critically reassesses the relationship between diverse religious movements, secularisms, and liberal democracies presents new questions for future research.

  {"id":"gottliebLearningHowBelieve2007","abstract":"Over the last decade, researchers have become increasingly interested in students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how these beliefs develop. Although initial psychological accounts portrayed epistemic development as a domain-independent process of cognitive maturation, recent studies have found trajectories of epistemic development to vary considerably across contexts. However, few studies have focused on cultural context. This article examines the role community values and practices play in fostering particular epistemological orientations by comparing the epistemological beliefs of 5th, 8th, and 12th graders (N = 200) from General and Religious schools in Israel regarding 2 controversies: belief in God and punishment of children. In both controversies, older participants were less likely than younger participants to consider the controversy rationally decidable. However, this shift emerged earlier in the God controversy than in the punishment controversy. In the God controversy, General pupils were less likely than Religious pupils to consider the question rationally decidable or their own beliefs infallible. But no such school differences were observed in the punishment controversy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses linked these differences to divergent discourse practices at General and Religious schools, suggesting that the relations between learning and epistemic development are more intricate than has been assumed hitherto. Epistemology is an area of philosophy concerned with questions of what knowledge is and how it is justified. Although few people give these questions such detailed and sustained attention as professional philosophers, anyone attempting to acquire, produce, or evaluate knowledge relies, at least implicitly, on some set of epistemological beliefs. Such beliefs are of obvious interest to educators. To understand how students acquire, evaluate, and justify knowledge, we need to understand what they consider knowledge to be. And to help students become discerning consumers and responsible producers of knowledge, we need to understand how people learn to exercise reflective judgment in the face of competing claims. The psychological study of epistemic development is undergoing something of a renaissance. Interest in this area can be traced back to Piaget (1970), Dewey (1933), and beyond (e.g., Plato's Theaetetus). But only recently have psychologists begun to draw together hitherto disparate strands of empirical inquiry to chart in detail the course of epistemic development from infancy to adulthood (see, e.g., Hallett, Chandler, & Krettenauer, 2002; Kuhn, Cheney, & Weinstock, 2000; Wainryb, Shaw, Langley, Cottam, & Lewis, 2004). Initial research in this field was conducted largely within a neo-Piagetian paradigm. Epistemic development was characterized as a progression through discrete stages or levels of epistemological understanding, each following the other in invariant sequence and constituting a comprehensive transformation of the individual's conception of knowledge (see, e.g., Chandler, 1975; Kitchener & King, 1981; Perry, 1970). Researchers differed somewhat in their nomenclatures and in their criteria for distinguishing levels of epistemological sophistication, but they concurred broadly in positing at least two major shifts in epistemological understanding (for recent reviews, see Hofer & Pintrich, 1997, 2002). Initially, the individual subscribes to an objectivist conception of knowledge, in which every question is believed to have a single, correct answer that is knowable with absolute certainty. Subsequently, in a radical shift, objectivism is abandoned in favor of subjectivism, and the individual equates all knowledge claims with matters of personal taste or preference. Finally, a balance is achieved in which objective and subjective aspects of knowing are coordinated. At this “evaluativist” stage (cf. Kuhn, 1991), the individual sees knowledge as something that is constructed tentatively by evaluating the evidence for and against competing beliefs and points of view. There was some debate about the precise relations of these stages to Piaget's stages of intellectual development (see, e.g., Boyes & Chandler, 1992). However, they were viewed by most researchers as a kind of “post-formal operations” taking up the formal operational attainments of hypothetical thinking and perspective-taking and applying them wholesale to knowledge claims as such, in a form of meta-metacognition (see, e.g., Kitchener, 1983; Kuhn, 2000; Moshman, 2003). Empirical support for this model of epistemic development came from several parallel research programs. Overall, these studies provided substantial evidence of development in the hypothesized direction (Hallett et al., 2002; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; King & Kitchener, 1994). However, the ages at which the key shifts in epistemological understanding were observed varied enormously from program to program. As Hallett et al. (2002) noted regarding the emergence of subjectivism, “one could read selectively from the literature and, with good reason, conclude that such abilities put in their appearance at either 4 or 6 or 8 or 12 or 16 or 20, or in receipt of a Ph.D.” (p. 289). These vast discrepancies have led researchers to reexamine some of the assump-tions underlying their models and measures of epistemic development. In particular, researchers have begun to question the comprehensiveness of shifts in epistemological understanding and to attend more closely to the variety of contexts within which epistemic beliefs are held, employed, and articulated (cf.Elby&Ham-mer, 2001; Hammer&Elby, 2002, 2003). This attention to context has taken several forms. One line of research has sought to show that epistemic development is a some-what domain-dependent process that occurs with respect to some kinds of knowledge claim before others. For example, it has been proposed that subjectivism emerges in relation to aesthetic claims before it emerges in relation to claims about the physical world (e.g., Hallett et al., 2002; Kuhn et al., 2000; Wainryb et al., 2004). Another line of research has sought to show that epistemological beliefs are multi di-mensional rather than unitary. For example, it has been proposed that people's beliefs about the complexity of knowledge develop more or less independently of their beliefs about its certainty (e.g., Schommer, 1990, 1993). Although the accumulated empirical evidence is as yet suggestive rather than conclusive (see Elby&Hammer, 2001; Hallett et al., 2002, pp. 303–304; Kuhn et al., 2000, pp. 321–322), both research programs hold out the possibility of disentangling the course of epistemic de-velopment by identifying elements of epistemological understanding that emerge at different points in the lifespan(cf.Hallett et al.,2002, p. 290; Wainryb et al. 2004). However, “domains” and “dimensions” are not the only contexts within which epistemic beliefs are situated. Just as people's epistemic beliefs may be affected by the particular content of the knowledge claims being evaluated, so too may they be affected by the particular procedures of knowledge evaluation practiced in, and sanctioned by, the communities in which they participate (cf. Hammer & Elby, 2003). Few studies have directly examined cross-cultural variation in epistemological beliefs. And those that have done so have tended to focus on comparisons between U.S. and East Asian college students (e.g., Chan & Elliott, 2002, 2004; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001; Zhang, 1999). Nonetheless, the findings of such studies are highly suggestive. Especially striking is Zhang's finding that Chinese students' epistemological beliefs shifted over the college years in exactly the opposite direction to those of their U.S. counterparts. Specifically, rather than moving from objectivist to subjectivist conceptions of knowledge, similar to their peers at U.S. universities, Chinese students appeared to shift from more subjectivist conceptions of knowledge to more objectivist ones. Such findings raise intriguing questions about the relations between culture and epistemic development, and about the relations between learning and epistemic development more generally. For a field of inquiry dominated by educational psychologists, remarkably little is known about these relations. As Hofer and Pintrich(1997) noted, “there is little empirical evidence for precisely what fosters epistemological development or how epistemological beliefs are altered” (p. 123). Research has shown that schooling makes a difference(e.g. Bell&Linn, 2002; King&Kitchener, 1994), but it has yielded little insight into how or why it makes a difference. Moreover, researchers have tended to equivocate between viewing epistemological beliefs as causes and effects of learning—as age-dependent constraints on instruction on one hand andasoutcomesof instructionon the other hand (cf. Kuhn, 1991, 2003; Schommer, 1990, 1993). Cross-cultural studies of age trends in epistemological belief are one way to investigate systematically the relations between age, learning, and epistemic development. If the nature and timing of age-related shifts in epistemological belief vary cross-culturally, then this is presumably because participants in different cultures learn, through participation in practices particular to their respective communities, to treat knowledge claims in different ways. To the extent that researchers can pinpoint such practices and measure their impact on individuals' epistemological beliefs, we can begin to characterize more precisely the relations between learning and epistemic development. However, in designing such studies, researchers must take great care to distinguish between reportage and editorial. “Development” is a value-laden term. Theoretical models of psychological development do more than describe a sequence; they attach values to different points along the sequence. Specifically, they define some psychological states or capacities as more mature, adequate, or sophisticated than others. When developmental studies are restricted to homogeneous cultural settings, within which there is little serious disagreement among experts about the relative adequacy of different psychological states or capacities, the risk of bias in diagnosing participants' levels of development is relatively slight. However, as the cultural heterogeneity of the sample increases, so too does the risk that the model on the basis of which participants' development is diagnosed is ethnocentrically biased against a portion of the sample. For example, beliefs that are defined as immature by the developmental model might be considered mature within one of the cultures from which the sample is drawn, or vice versa. These dangers exist to some extent in all cross-cultural studies of psychological development (see Cole & Scribner, 1974; Greenfield & Bruner, 1966; Shweder, Mahapatra, & Miller, 1990). However, in cross-cultural studies of epistemic development the danger is even more clear and present. This is because there are at least four levels at which epistemological judgments can be made, and as one ascends from the first level to the fourth, the value assumptions implicit in these judgments become less visible to the naked eye but never quite disappear. At the first, most basic level, there arejudgments about the epistemic status of par-ticular claims, such as whether a given assertion (e.g., “Eating people is wrong”) is known or merely believed (e.g., “John doesn't know that eating people is wrong; he merely believes that eating people is wrong”). At one level of abstraction up from such judgments, there are judgments about the epistemic status of general classes of claim, such as judgments about whether knowledge is possible about, say, matters of aesthetics or morality (e.g., “There are no such things as moral truths or moral knowledge; morality is a question of commitment—not of what is or is not the case”). At yet another level of abstraction up from such judgments, there are further judgments about the criteria by which epistemic states are distinguished one from another, such as judgments about what differentiates knowledge from belief or opin-ion (e.g., “Knowledge is justified true belief;if a belief is true but not justified, or jus-tified but not true, then it isn't known”). And beyond this third level, there is a fourth level of judgments about the relative adequacy of particular criteria for distinguishing between epistemic states, such as judgments about whether the subjectivist equation of knowledge with opinion is less adequate than the evaluativist's insistence that knowledge differs from opinion in being supported by evidence (e.g., “Subjectivism is inferior to evaluativism because it fails to account for our belief that some claims are better supported than others”). According to this analysis, authors of contemporary models of epistemic development are themselves exercising a form of epistemological judgment in articulating their models. Specifically, they are operating at the fourth level (outlined previously), expressing their own beliefs about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological orientations. This is all well and good as long as the beliefs in question are compatible with the epistemological beliefs, values, and practices of the communities to which the model is applied. However, in cross-cultural studies of epistemic development, such compatibility cannot be assumed in advance of the investigation itself. Accordingly, if one wishes to avoid ethnocentrism, one cannot conduct a cross-cultural study of epistemic development without suspending, at least temporarily, one's hierarchical assumptions about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological orientations. This is not to say that researchers are not entitled to opinions of their own about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological beliefs or that all talk of epistemic development is inherently ethnocentric. It is merely to point out that because standards of epistemological maturity may themselves vary across cultures, assumptions about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological beliefs must not be built into the design of cross-cultural studies. This study, therefore, departs from previous studies of epistemic development by dropping the assumption that some epistemological beliefs are inherently more adequate than others. By dropping this assumption, I do not affirm the contrary assumption that all epistemological beliefs are equally adequate. Rather, I adopt a form of methodological agnosticism to reduce the scope for ethnocentric bias in the study'sdesign. In the Discussion section, I return to the question of hierarchy and review the assumptions of contemporary models of epistemic development in light of my findings. This study investigates the relations between age, learning, and epistemic devel-opment by comparing the epistemological beliefs of pupil sat Religious schools and General schools in Israel about two controversies: one religious and the other nonre-ligious. Specifically, this study asks three questions. First, how do beliefs about the nature of religious claims vary with age and school? Second, to what extent are these age and school differences attributable to underlying group differences in religious commitment and general epistemological sophistication? Third, how are variations in epistemological belief across ages, schools, and controversies related to educational practices at Religious and General schools, respectively?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gottlieb","given":"Eli"},{"family":"Institute","given":"Mandel   Leadership"}],"citation-key":"gottliebLearningHowBelieve2007","container-title":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","DOI":"10.1080/10508400709336941","ISSN":"1050-8406","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",2,1]]},"page":"5-35","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Learning How to Believe: Epistemic Development in Cultural Context","title-short":"Learning How to Believe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400709336941","volume":"16"},

Navigating between the competing commitments of their faith communities on the one hand and an academic guild on the other, religious historians engaged in epistemic switching, varying epistemological criteria to align with the allegiances triggered by the document under review. To explain these findings, we propose that historical understanding be conceived not as a unitary construct but as a form of coordination between multiple axes: a vertical axis of increasing intellectual sophistication as defined by the discipline; and a horizontal axis of identification and commitment, along which individuals move between a variety of allegiances and affiliations as they engage the epistemological criteria of sacred history.

  {"id":"grabensteinWhatWorldsReligions2013","abstract":"For millennia, humans have sought and found purpose, solace, values, understanding, and fellowship in religious practices. Buddhist nuns performed variolation against smallpox over 1000 years ago. Since Jenner developed vaccination against smallpox in 1796, some people have objected to and declined vaccination, citing various religious reasons. This paper reviews the scriptural, canonical basis for such interpretations, as well as passages that support immunization. Populous faith traditions are considered, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Subjects of concern such as blood components, pharmaceutical excipients of porcine or bovine origin, rubella strain RA 27/3, and cell-culture media with remote fetal origins are evaluated against the religious concerns identified. The review identified more than 60 reports or evaluations of vaccine-preventable infectious-disease outbreaks that occurred within religious communities or that spread from them to broader communities. In multiple cases, ostensibly religious reasons to decline immunization actually reflected concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs among a social network of people organized around a faith community, rather than theologically based objections per se. Themes favoring vaccine acceptance included transformation of vaccine excipients from their starting material, extensive dilution of components of concern, the medicinal purpose of immunization (in contrast to diet), and lack of alternatives. Other important features included imperatives to preserve health and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, among neighbors). Concern that ‘the body is a temple not to be defiled’ is contrasted with other teaching and quality-control requirements in manufacturing vaccines and immune globulins. Health professionals who counsel hesitant patients or parents can ask about the basis for concern and how the individual applies religious understanding to decision-making about medical products, explain facts about content and processes, and suggest further dialog with informed religious leaders. Key considerations for observant believers for each populous religion are described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Grabenstein","given":"John D."}],"citation-key":"grabensteinWhatWorldsReligions2013","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.02.026","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,12]]},"language":"en","page":"2011-2023","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What the World's religions teach, applied to vaccines and immune globulins","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13001898","volume":"31"},

Researchers have argued that epistemic cognition is a key predictor of many 21st century learning outcomes including critical thinking, scientific literacy, and historical thinking, among others. Despite a large volume of quantitative empirical research on epistemic cognition and academic achievement, there has been no published systematic analysis of this literature. We conducted a meta-analysis of 132 nonexperimental studies in this literature, and found epistemic cognition, as measured predominantly in terms of beliefs, was positively correlated with academic achievement, r = .162, p < .001, indicating a small but meaningful relationship. Moderator analyses revealed models and instruments focusing on development and justification of knowledge had higher correlations with academic achievement than those focused on constructs related to authority. We found evidence supporting domain-general, domain-specific, and topic-specific conceptualizations of epistemic cognition, and stronger correlations when the specificity of the epistemic cognition measure matched the specificity of the achievement measure. Conceptual knowledge and argumentation performance were more strongly associated with epistemic cognition than declarative or procedural knowledge performance. Finally, we found epistemic cognition predicted academic achievement from elementary school through graduate school, suggesting the importance of studying epistemic cognition across all educational levels. These findings have direct implications for honing epistemic cognition theory, creating better measures of epistemic cognition, and developing effective educational interventions on this critical topic.

Methods/Principal Findings Participants (N = 662) indicated whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Afterwards, they evaluated two opposing summaries of fictitious studies on the effects of violent video play. They also reported whether their initial belief had changed after reading the two summaries and indicated again whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Results showed that believers evaluated the study showing an effect more favorably than a study showing no effect, whereas the opposite was observed for skeptics. Moreover, both believers and skeptics reported to become more convinced of their initial view. In contrast, for actual attitude change, a depolarization effect was found.

The current study tests (a) patterns of evaluation in crossed categorization scenarios when more than two real-life categorization dimensions are crossed, and (b) the moderating role of identity importance. We conduct a factorial survey experiment with a diverse sample (N = 524), crossing eight categorization dimensions. The results provide strong support for the additive pattern of crossed categorization, challenging the view that with an increased number of categories category-based information processing will not be used. Identity importance predicts the strength of intergroup bias only on the dimension of religion, which was the dominant dimension in this sample. The study contributes to multiple and crossed categorization literature by testing some of its key assumptions using a design that increases the ecological validity of the findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Grigoryan","given":"Lusine"}],"citation-key":"grigoryanCrossedCategorizationOutside2020","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10/gpdt4w","ISSN":"1099-0992","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"983-1000","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Crossed categorization outside the lab: Findings from a factorial survey experiment","title-short":"Crossed categorization outside the lab","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2656","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"grimesEstablishingTaxonomyPotential2020","abstract":"Objectives Disinformation on medical matters has become an increasing public health concern. Public engagement by scientists, clinicians and patient advocates can contribute towards public understanding of medicine. However, depth of feeling on many issues (notably vaccination and cancer) can lead to adverse reactions for those communicating medical science, including vexatious interactions and targeted campaigns. Our objective in this work is to establish a taxonomy of common negative experiences encountered by those communicating medical science, and suggest guidelines so that they may be circumvented.\nDesign We establish a taxonomy of the common negative experiences reported by those communicating medical science, informed by surveying medical science communicators with public platforms.\nParticipants 142 prominent medical science communicators (defined as having >1000 Twitter followers and experience communicating medical science on social and traditional media platforms) were invited to take part in a survey, with 101 responses.\nResults 101 responses were analysed. Most participants experienced abusive behaviour (91.9%), including persistent harassment (69.3%) and physical violence and intimidation (5.9%). A substantial number (38.6%) received vexatious complaints to their employers, professional bodies or legal intimidation. The majority (62.4%) reported negative mental health sequelae due to public outreach, including depression, anxiety and stress. A significant minority (19.8%) were obligated to seek police advice or legal counsel due to actions associated with their outreach work. While the majority targeted with vexatious complaints felt supported by their employer/professional body, 32.4% reported neutral, poor or non-existent support.\nConclusions Those engaging in public outreach of medical science are vulnerable to negative repercussions, and we suggest guidelines for professional bodies and organisations to remedy some of these impacts on front-line members.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimes","given":"David Robert"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"grimesEstablishingTaxonomyPotential2020","container-title":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035626","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

  {"id":"grimesViabilityConspiratorialBeliefs2016","abstract":"Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas where the science is well established. Conversely, historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals, and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active participants—the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimes","given":"David Robert"}],"citation-key":"grimesViabilityConspiratorialBeliefs2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0147905","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"e0147905","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905","volume":"11"},

Regression and path analyses were conducted on a sample of nine civic education classes at the eighth and ninth grades (N = 221 students) in North Rhine-Westphalia. Results primarily confirmed expectations and revealed that participation in controversial classroom discussions, but not in teacher-led classroom talk, was clearly associated with relatively stable personality traits and dispositions.

Two hundred university student volunteers participated in 3 studies. Study One (N = 87; mixed male and female sample) found that state-anxiety and trait-anxiety, measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), were positively correlated with conspiracy thinking about Jewish people, Germans and Arabs. Study Two (N = 46; male sample) and Study Three (N = 67; female sample) were designed to check whether a high-anxiety situation (connected with waiting for an examination) would increase conspiracy thinking. Findings from Studies Two and Three showed that the pre-exam (high-anxiety) situation increased conspiracy thinking about Jewish people. This effect was not mediated by state-anxiety. Hence, further research should focus on searching for possible mediators of the relationship between a pre-exam situation and conspiracy thinking. The obtained results are consistent with previous findings showing that conspiracy thinking about Jewish people is sensitive to situational factors and with findings on links between anxiety and processing information about threat-related stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grzesiak-Feldman","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"grzesiak-feldmanEffectHighAnxietySituations2013","container-title":"Current Psychology","container-title-short":"Curr Psychol","DOI":"10.1007/s12144-013-9165-6","ISSN":"1936-4733","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100-118","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Effect of High-Anxiety Situations on Conspiracy Thinking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-013-9165-6","volume":"32"},

To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents’ sharing activity as recorded in Facebook profile data. First and foremost, we find that sharing this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in orientation, than liberals or moderates.

  {"id":"guoRelationsEpistemicBeliefs2022","abstract":"The proliferation of information and divergent viewpoints in the 21st century requires an educated citizenry with the ability to critically evaluate information and make informed decisions. To meet this demand, adaptive epistemic understandings and beliefs about the nature of knowledge are needed, such as believing that scientific knowledge is evolving (development of knowledge) and needs to be justified through experimentation (justification of knowledge). Our study is the first to use nationally representative samples from 72 societies (PISA2015 database; N= 514,119 students) to examine how scientific epistemic beliefs about development and justification of knowledge in science are associated with students’ science motivation, achievement, and career aspirations in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, as well as the cross-national generalizability of these relations. Results showed that (a) students who had more adaptive beliefs about knowledge being changeable and stemming from experimentation were likely to have high science self-efficacy, utility value, and particularly high intrinsic value; (b) epistemic beliefs were more strongly linked to science achievement than were motivational constructs; (c) the positive relation between epistemic beliefs and STEM-related career aspirations was largely explained by motivation and achievement; (d) the pattern of results generalized well across societies. Our findings suggest that epistemic beliefs are substantially positively associated with adolescents’ science learning, implying that developing effective interventions that focus on development and justification of knowledge would be fruitful for promoting science educational outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Jiesi"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Herbert W."},{"family":"Pekrun","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"guoRelationsEpistemicBeliefs2022","container-title":"Journal of Educational Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/edu0000660","ISSN":"1939-2176, 0022-0663","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"734-751","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relations of epistemic beliefs with motivation, achievement, and aspirations in science: Generalizability across 72 societies.","title-short":"Relations of epistemic beliefs with motivation, achievement, and aspirations in science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/edu0000660","volume":"114"},

Because social grievances related to endemic issues like social injustice are increasingly being framed through Islamic cultural references, there will be implications for the workings of Indonesian democracy, premised on secular state institutions. But this does not lead to the sort of post-Islamism associated by Bayat with Iran, where the imperatives of running a modern state and economy once purportedly enabled pluralist social inclinations, albeit within an Islamised polity. Nor does it lead to the generalised ‘Islamisation of radicalism’ envisaged by Roy. Rather, what is witnessed is the substantial, though by no means uncontested, mainstreaming of social grievances through the lexicon of Islamic politics within Indonesian democracy even if there has been no take-over of the state by Islamic forces. The adoption of such framings even in the former bastions of the Indonesian Communist Party, once the third largest in the world, provides important insights into how hegemonic contests have taken place in the Muslim world after the end of the Cold War.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hadiz","given":"Vedi R."}],"citation-key":"hadizIndonesiasMissingLeft2020","container-title":"Third World Quarterly","container-title-short":"Third World Quarterly","DOI":"10.1080/01436597.2020.1768064","ISSN":"0143-6597, 1360-2241","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indonesia’s missing Left and the Islamisation of dissent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2020.1768064"},

To characterize the level of generalizability of students’ science interests over 600 high school students from Portugal, Turkey, England and Israel, who chose biology as an advanced subject, their interest level was ranked in 36 questions that were originally raised by Israeli students. Results indicate that students from four different countries show interest in similar science questions. The most intriguing questions were the ones that dealt with human health and new developments in reproduction and genetics. Religious affiliation had the strongest effect on students’ interest level, followed by national affiliation and gender.

  {"id":"haimilaDoesScienceOrientedWorldview2020","abstract":"Abstract Endorsement of science is often associated with non-religiosity and lack of supernatural belief. However, the relevance of science for worldviews might also relate to the cultural context and/or personal investment in science. This study investigates the following question: Is endorsement of worldview components of science associated with unbelief among science-oriented respondents? Here, worldview components refer to science providing 1) a sense of meaning, 2) moral standards, and 3) literal or symbolic continuity after death. 387 Finnish adults recruited via pro-research organizations were included in the analysis. The results suggest that self-reported worldview functions of science are associated with unbelief also among science-oriented individuals. These findings lend support to the belief replacement hypothesis, which suggests that secular worldviews such as belief in science are of particular importance for unbelievers.

  {"id":"haimilaScientificWorldviewsBelief2023","abstract":"Previous work in the study of religion indicates that although science and supernatural belief (including religious belief) are often seen as contradictory, people across various cultures apply both scientific and supernatural explanations for the same events. Furthermore, some individuals integrate scientific and supernatural accounts into a singular explanation – for example, by referring to God’s design in human evolution. In the cognitive science of religion (CSR), applying both causal models is referred to as ‘explanatory coexistence’. Although there is extensive work on supernatural beliefs in different cultures, the research has been characterised by two shortcomings. First, ‘supernatural’ explanations have mainly been operationalised as beliefs perceived as supernatural in the Western context (such as religious beliefs). Second, few studies have investigated the relationship between belief in science and the supernatural in individuals who hold science in high regard, as people with ‘scientific worldviews’ are generally expected to endorse few, if any, supernatural beliefs.","author":[{"family":"Haimila","given":"Roosa"}],"citation-key":"haimilaScientificWorldviewsBelief2023","event-place":"Helsinki","genre":"Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"289","publisher":"University of Helsinki","publisher-place":"Helsinki","source":"Zotero","title":"Beyond Scientific Worldviews: Belief in Science and  'Supernatural’ Explanations in Science-Oriented Individuals","type":"thesis","URL":"https://helda.helsinki.fi/items/5c3f9d35-bebb-4d3a-ae82-b32f3a1d9f3b"},
  {"id":"haimilaSupernaturalBeliefScientific2024","abstract":"Abstract A ‘scientific worldview’ is commonly seen as contradictory to belief in supernatural forces, and there is little research on the supernatural beliefs of individuals who identify with science. In this article, we investigate the supernatural explanations of science-oriented individuals in domains of fundamental concern (suffering, death, and origins), and how supernatural causality is reconciled with belief in science. The open-ended responses of 387 Finns were analysed. The results show that science-oriented Finns endorsed both religion-related and more secular supernatural beliefs (such as belief in evolution as a purposeful process). Following the coexistence model, science-oriented Finns applied synthetic and target-dependent reasoning. In addition, many who invoked supernatural explanations integrated supernatural causality with science. Two forms of integrated reasoning were found: 1) supernatural agency as the ultimate cause and scientific theory as the proximate cause, and 2) a similarity-based heuristic, as seen in afterlife beliefs appealing to the law of conservation of energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Haimila","given":"Roosa"},{"family":"Metsähinen","given":"Hanne"},{"family":"Sevalnev","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"haimilaSupernaturalBeliefScientific2024","container-title":"Journal of Cognition and Culture","DOI":"10.1163/15685373-12340181","ISSN":"1568-5373, 1567-7095","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-34","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"Supernatural Belief in ‘Scientific’ Worldviews?: Investigating Science-oriented Finns’ Explanations for Origins, Death and Suffering","title-short":"Supernatural Belief in ‘Scientific’ Worldviews?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/24/1-2/article-p1_1.xml","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hallWhyDontWe2010","abstract":"A meta-analytic review of past research evaluated the link between religiosity and racism in the United States since the Civil Rights Act. Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to ingroup members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Deborah L."},{"family":"Matz","given":"David C."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Wendy"}],"citation-key":"hallWhyDontWe2010","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/1088868309352179","ISSN":"1088-8683, 1532-7957","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"language":"en","page":"126-139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

  {"id":"halseyReignPvalueWhat2019","abstract":"The p-value has long been the figurehead of statistical analysis in biology, but its position is under threat. p is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Halsey","given":"Lewis G."}],"citation-key":"halseyReignPvalueWhat2019","container-title":"Biology Letters","container-title-short":"Biology Letters","DOI":"10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,31]]},"page":"20190174","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The reign of the p-value is over: what alternative analyses could we employ to fill the power vacuum?","title-short":"The reign of the p-value is over","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174","volume":"15"},

There have been reports of boycotts of university evolution lectures and, in one extreme case, even a threat of violence. While religious objections are indeed at play in some cases, our understanding of the rise of Islamic creationism should also take into account socioeconomic disparities and its impact on education for Muslim minorities in Europe. Furthermore, the broader narrative of rejection of evolution in Europe, for some Muslims, may be bound up in reactions to the secular culture and in the formation of their own minority religious identity. On the other hand, the stories of Muslim rejection of evolution in media end up reinforcing the stereotype of Muslims as ?outsiders? and a threat to the European education system. A nuanced understanding of this dynamic may benefit those who support both the propagation of good science and favor cultural pluralism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hameed","given":"Salman"}],"citation-key":"hameedMakingSenseIslamic2015","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662514555055","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"388-399","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Making sense of Islamic creationism in Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662514555055","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hanleyInterrelationshipScienceReligion2014","abstract":"This study explores whether the religious background of students affects their opinions about and attitudes to engaging with scientific explanations of the origins of the universe and of life. The study took place in four English secondary schools representing three different contexts (Christian faith-based; non-faith with majority Muslim catchment; and non-faith, mixed catchment). It comprised questionnaires and focus groups with over 200 students aged 14–16, supplemented by teacher interviews. The analysis approach was informed by grounded theory and resulted in the development of an engagement typology, which has been set in the context of the cross-cultural border crossing literature. It divides students into categories depending on both the nature and amount of engagement they were prepared to have with the relationship between science and religion. The model takes into account where students sit on four dimensions. These assess whether a student's preferred knowledge base is belief-based or fact-based; their tolerance of uncertainty (do they have a need for resolution?); their open mindedness (are they unquestioning or inquiring?); and whether they conceptualise science and religion as being in conflict or harmony. Many Muslim students resisted engagement because of conflicting religious beliefs. Teachers did not always appreciate the extent to which this topic troubled some students who needed help to accommodate clashes between science and their religious beliefs. It is suggested that increased appreciation of the complexity represented by their students can guide a teacher towards an appropriate approach when covering potentially sensitive topics such as the theory of evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hanley","given":"Pam"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Ratcliffe","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"hanleyInterrelationshipScienceReligion2014","container-title":"International Journal of Science Education","DOI":"10.1080/09500693.2013.853897","ISSN":"0950-0693","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,3]]},"page":"1210-1229","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Inter-relationship of Science and Religion: A typology of engagement","title-short":"The Inter-relationship of Science and Religion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2013.853897","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"hanssonScienceDenialForm2017","abstract":"Science denialism poses a serious threat to human health and the long-term sustainability of human civilization. Although it has recently been rather extensively discussed, this discussion has rarely been connected to the extensive literature on pseudoscience and the science-pseudoscience demarcation. This contribution argues that science denialism should be seen as one of the two major forms of pseudoscience, alongside of pseudotheory promotion. A detailed comparison is made between three prominent forms of science denialism, namely relativity theory denialism, evolution denialism, and climate science denialism. Several characteristics are identiﬁed that distinguish science denialism from other forms of pseudoscience, in particular its persistent fabrication of fake controversies, the extraordinary male dominance among its activists, and its strong connection with various forms of right-wing politics. It is argued that the scientiﬁc response to science denialism has to be conceived with these characteristics in mind. In particular, it is important to expose the fabricated fake controversies for what they are and to reveal how science denialists consistently use deviant criteria of assent to distort the scientiﬁc process.

Based on data gathered from a sample of students attending a public university located in the northeast U.S., multiple regression analyses indicated: 1) RWA and SDO-D were predictors of economic conservatism; 2) only RWA predicted social conservatism; and 3) RWA and RF predicted foreign policy conservatism.

Yet given the radically different trajectory of scientific as compared to religious beliefs across human history, it is plausible that the psychological basis for beliefs in these two domains is also different. Indeed, there is evidence from children and adults in various cultures that people have greater confidence in their scientific beliefs than in their religious beliefs. However, when individuals are invited to indicate the basis for their beliefs within each domain, a surprisingly similar pattern of justification is apparent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul L"},{"family":"Corriveau","given":"Kathleen H"}],"citation-key":"harrisBeliefsChildrenAdults2021","collection-title":"Religion","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2020.08.003","ISSN":"2352-250X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20-23","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Beliefs of children and adults in religious and scientific phenomena","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X20301482","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"harrisChildrensAcceptanceConflicting2005","abstract":"Abstract Children aged 7 and 11 years were interviewed about death in the context of two different narratives. Each narrative described the death of a grandparent but one narrative provided a secular context whereas the other provided a religious context. Following each narrative, children were asked to judge whether various bodily and mental processes continue to function after death, and to justify their judgment. Children displayed two different conceptions of death. They often acknowledged that functioning ceases at death and offered appropriate biological justifications for that judgment. However, they also claimed that functioning continues after death and offered appropriate religious justifications. The tendency to claim that functioning continues after death was more frequent among older children than younger children, more frequent in the context of the religious narrative as opposed to the secular narrative and more frequent with respect to mental processes than bodily processes. Particularly among older children, two distinct conceptions of death appear to co-exist: a biological conception in which death implies the cessation of living processes and a metaphysical conception in which death marks the beginning of the afterlife.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Giménez","given":"Marta"}],"citation-key":"harrisChildrensAcceptanceConflicting2005","container-title":"Journal of Cognition and Culture","DOI":"10.1163/1568537054068606","ISSN":"1568-5373, 1567-7095","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"143-164","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"Children's Acceptance of Conflicting Testimony: The Case of Death","title-short":"Children's Acceptance of Conflicting Testimony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/5/1-2/article-p143_6.xml","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"harrisCognitiveFoundationsLearning2018","abstract":"Humans acquire much of their knowledge from the testimony of other people. An understanding of the way that information can be conveyed via gesture and vocalization is present in infancy. Thus, infants seek information from well-informed interlocutors, supply information to the ignorant, and make sense of communicative acts that they observe from a third-party perspective. This basic understanding is refined in the course of development. As they age, children's reasoning about testimony increasingly reflects an ability not just to detect imperfect or inaccurate claims but also to assess what inferences may or may not be drawn about informants given their particular situation. Children also attend to the broader characteristics of particular informants—their group membership, personality characteristics, and agreement or disagreement with other potential informants. When presented with unexpected or counterintuitive testimony, children are prone to set aside their own prior convictions, but they may sometimes defer to informants for inherently social reasons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Melissa A."},{"family":"Corriveau","given":"Kathleen H."},{"family":"Jaswal","given":"Vikram K."}],"citation-key":"harrisCognitiveFoundationsLearning2018","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011710","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"251-273","PMID":"28793811","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Cognitive Foundations of Learning from Testimony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011710","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"harrisFaithConceptsPsychology2018","abstract":"How does the psychology of religion literature define the terms religiousness, spirituality, faith, and sacred? Despite the growing interest in and recognition of spirituality and religiousness in psychology, these faith constructs remain poorly defined. We conducted a literature review, comparing existing definitions of these 4 constructs, looking for a consensus, and presenting 4 preliminary working definitions based on the literature. We then undertook 3 studies to find out the prototype phenomena being used by peer-reviewed psychology of religion authors when they define these terms. All 3 studies used definitional content analysis, a procedure based on narrative analysis, grounded theory, and Consensual Qualitative Research. Study 1 examined how 34 articles defined the term spirituality. Study 2 examined how 36 articles defined the term religiousness. Study 3 examined how 471 articles defined the terms religiousness, spirituality, faith, and sacred. The results of these 3 studies indicate that these 4 terms are multidimensional, overlapping, and often poorly defined; nevertheless, the basic elements of their meanings can be discerned. Spirituality, religiousness, faith, and the sacred involve 20, 19, 20, and 9 discernible characteristics, respectively. We propose 4 research-based operational definitions for future research. Specifically, we propose that spirituality is a search for or relationship with the sacred; religiousness is ritual, institutional, or codified spirituality which is culturally sanctioned; faith is a synonym for spirituality and/or religiousness; and the sacred is manifestations of the divine, existential meaningfulness, or an ultimate concern as perceived by an individual.

  {"id":"harrisGermsAngelsRole2006","abstract":"In three experiments, children's reliance on other people's testimony as compared to their own, first-hand experience was assessed in the domain of ontology. Children ranging from 4 to 8 years were asked to judge whether five different types of entity exist: real entities (e.g. cats, trees) whose existence is evident to everyone; scientific entities (e.g. germs, oxygen) that are normally invisible but whose existence is generally presupposed in everyday discourse; endorsed beings (e.g. the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus) whose existence is typically endorsed in discourse with young children; equivocal beings (e.g. monsters, witches) whose existence is not typically endorsed in discourse with young children; and impossible entities (e.g. flying pigs, barking cats) that nobody believes in. Children make a broad dichotomy between entities and beings that they claim to exist (real entities; scientific entities; and endorsed beings) and those whose existence they deny (equivocal beings and impossible entities). They also make a more fine-grained distinction among the invisible entities that they claim to exist. Thus, they assert the existence of scientific entities such as germs with more confidence than that of endorsed beings such as Santa Claus. The findings confirm that children's ontological claims extend beyond their first-hand encounters with instances of a given category. Children readily believe in entities that they cannot see for themselves but have been told about. Their confidence in the existence of those entities appears to vary with the pattern of testimony that they receive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Elisabeth S."},{"family":"Duke","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Asscher","given":"Jessica J."},{"family":"Pons","given":"Francisco"}],"citation-key":"harrisGermsAngelsRole2006","container-title":"Developmental Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00465.x","ISSN":"1467-7687","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"76-96","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Germs and angels: the role of testimony in young children's ontology","title-short":"Germs and angels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00465.x","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"harrisNeuralCorrelatesReligious2009","abstract":"Background While religious faith remains one of the most significant features of human life, little is known about its relationship to ordinary belief at the level of the brain. Nor is it known whether religious believers and nonbelievers differ in how they evaluate statements of fact. Our lab previously has used functional neuroimaging to study belief as a general mode of cognition [1], and others have looked specifically at religious belief [2]. However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly. Methodology/Principal Findings We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects—fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers—as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief (judgments of “true” vs judgments of “false”) was associated with greater signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area important for self-representation [3], [4], [5], [6], emotional associations [7], reward [8], [9], [10], and goal-driven behavior [11]. This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. A comparison of both stimulus categories suggests that religious thinking is more associated with brain regions that govern emotion, self-representation, and cognitive conflict, while thinking about ordinary facts is more reliant upon memory retrieval networks. Conclusions/Significance While religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes, the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. Our study compares religious thinking with ordinary cognition and, as such, constitutes a step toward developing a neuropsychology of religion. However, these findings may also further our understanding of how the brain accepts statements of all kinds to be valid descriptions of the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Jonas T."},{"family":"Curiel","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Bookheimer","given":"Susan Y."},{"family":"Iacoboni","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Mark S."}],"citation-key":"harrisNeuralCorrelatesReligious2009","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0007272","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e7272","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The Neural Correlates of Religious and Nonreligious Belief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007272","volume":"4"},

By tracing the history of these concepts for the first time in parallel, he illuminates alternative boundaries and little-known relations between them--thereby making it possible for us to learn from their true history, and see other possible ways that scientific study and the religious life might relate to, influence, and mutually enrich each other.A tour de force by a distinguished scholar working at the height of his powers, The Territories of Science and Religion promises to forever alter the way we think about these fundamental pillars of human life and experience.","author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"harrisonTerritoriesScienceReligion2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 822090002","title":"The Territories of Science and Religion","type":"book"},

Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it. Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations. Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community-social, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself. The narrative work and policy actions entailed in actualizing such changes will, we expect, be essential in achieving a true vaccine confidence, however the public reacts to the specific vaccine that may be developed for COVID-19.","author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Julia W."}],"citation-key":"harrisonVaccineConfidenceTime2020","container-title":"European Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"Eur J Epidemiol","DOI":"10/ggv4rp","ISSN":"1573-7284","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"325-330","PMCID":"PMC7174145","PMID":"32318915","source":"PubMed","title":"Vaccine confidence in the time of COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

Children also learn from other people's testimony. For example, they learn that mental processes depend on the brain, that the earth is spherical, and that hidden bodily organs constrain life and death. Such learning might indicate that other people's testimony simply amplifies children's access to empirical data. However, children's understanding of God's special powers and the afterlife shows that their acceptance of others' testimony extends beyond the empirical domain. Thus, children appear to conceptualize unobservable scientific and religious entities similarly.

It is argued that the conflict thesis is only meaningful when examined from a specific socio-historical perspective. The dialectical relation between science and religion should therefore be considered at both a macro and micro level. At the macro level broad changes in the meaning of science and religion occur; whereas at the micro level individuals immersed within particular expressions of these concepts socially construct, re-construct, and appropriate meaning. Specific attention is given to expressions of meaning surrounding sacred texts in this dialectical relation. Two ontological forms of meaning are examined through a qualitative content analysis of 16 interviews with individuals from various religious affiliation and academic attainment. A monistic ontology constructs textual meaning as facts that have the qualities of being both self-evident and certain. Potential tension arises with scientific discourse given empirical evidence may either confirm or conflict with scriptural interpretation. The pluralistic ontology constructs textual meaning with multiple categories, which in turn have the qualities of being mediated by human consciousness and uncertain. The science-religion dichotomy appears to be less susceptible to conflict given the uncertainty embedded in this construction of scriptural meaning.

We describe an overfitting hypothesis, according to which (a) such theories overfit conspiracy-related data at the expense of wider generalisability, and (b) reasoning biases reflect, at least in part, the need to reduce the resulting dissonance between the conspiracy theory and wider data. This hypothesis implies that reasoning biases should be more closely associated with belief in implausible conspiracy theories (e.g., the moon landing was faked) than with more plausible ones (e.g., the Russian Federation orchestrated the attack on Sergei Skripal). In two pre-registered studies, we found that endorsement of implausible conspiracy theories, but not plausible ones, was associated with reduced information sampling in an information-foraging task and with less reflective reasoning. Thus, the relationship between belief in conspiracy theories and reasoning is not homogeneous, and reasoning is not linked specifically to the “conspiracy” aspect of conspiracy theories. Instead, it may reflect an adaptive response to the tension between implausible theories and other beliefs and data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hattersley","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Gordon D.

Using evidence from linguistic corpora (Study 1) and behavioral experiments (Studies 2–4), the current work provides evidence that individuals typically use the word believe more in conjunction with statements about religious credences and think more in conjunction with factual statements, pointing to two different understandings of claims made with these two terms. These patterns do not appear to reflect low-level differences based on the amount of consensus surrounding a particular claim, the extent to which the truth of a particular claim is known to the participant, or linguistic differences between religious and factual statements. We discuss implications of these findings for religious cognition (e.g., as supporting the theory that religious credences are qualitatively distinct from factual beliefs) as well as cognitive processes more broadly. Finally, we relate the present findings to prior theoretical work on differences between factual belief and religious credence.

  {"id":"heiphetzWhatDifferentBeliefs2014","abstract":"Children and adults differentiate statements of religious belief from statements of fact and opinion, but the basis of that differentiation remains unclear. Across three experiments, adults and 8–10-year-old children heard statements of factual, opinion-based, and religious belief. Adults and children judged that statements of factual belief revealed more about the world, statements of opinion revealed more about individuals, and statements of religious belief provided information about both. Children—unlike adults—judged that statements of religious belief revealed more about the world than the believer. These results led to three conclusions. First, judgments concerning the relative amount of information statements of religious belief provide about individuals change across development, perhaps because adults have more experience with diversity. Second, recognizing that statements of religious belief provide information about both the world and the believer does not require protracted learning. Third, statements of religious belief are interpreted as amalgams of factual and opinion-based statements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Heiphetz","given":"Larisa"},{"family":"Spelke","given":"Elizabeth S."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"Banaji","given":"Mahzarin R."}],"citation-key":"heiphetzWhatDifferentBeliefs2014","container-title":"Cognitive Development","container-title-short":"Cognitive Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.cogdev.2013.12.002","ISSN":"0885-2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"15-29","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What do different beliefs tell us?

However, scientific knowledge includes uncertainty, as does knowledge about COVID-19. In an experimental study, we tested how the trustworthiness (on the three dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence) of a source of information (either a scientist or a politician), was affected when messages were either two-sided (including arguments pro and contra the effectiveness of mask-wearing) or one-sided (only pro arguments). Results showed that scientists were ascribed more expertise and integrity compared to politicians, and both sources were ascribed more expertise when they gave two-sided (instead of one-sided) information. Moreover, trustworthiness ratings on all three dimensions were affected by participants’ prior topic attitudes and epistemic certainty beliefs. These findings underline that when a source provides two-sided information, this may increase people’s willingness to trust that source.

In this preregistered experiment (N = 484), we varied (a) whether a replication attempt was successful or not and (b) whether the replication was authored by the same, or another lab. Results showed that ratings of study credibility (e.g. evidence strength, ηP2 = .15) and researcher trustworthiness (e.g. expertise, ηP2 = .15) were rated higher upon learning of replication success, and lower in case of replication failure. The replication’s author did not make a meaningful difference. Prior beliefs acted as covariate for ratings of credibility, but not trustworthiness, while epistemic beliefs regarding the certainty of knowledge were a covariate to both.

  {"id":"hendriksTrustScienceScience2016","abstract":"When risky technologies are debated in the media or when cases of scientific misconduct are made public, inevitable discussions arise about public loss of trust in science. However, trust in science reaches far beyond such incidents: trust is of much more fundamental importance for science. Clearly, trust is pivotal in doing science, since researchers in their everyday practice rely on the knowledge produced by other experts with different specialization and expertise. In the same way, trust is fundamental for the public understanding of science. Laypeople depend on the knowledge of scientific experts when developing a personal stance on science-based issues and arriving at decisions about them. Laypeople only possess a bounded understanding of science, but nowadays they are able to rapidly access all kinds of scientific knowledge online. To deal with scientific information, laypeople have to trust in scientists and their findings. We will at first describe the role of trust in doing and understanding science. Then a summary of international survey results on the general public’s trust in science are presented. Starting from these results and questions that arise from them, we extend and revise past conceptualizations of trust, arriving at a conceptualization of epistemic trust. Epistemic trust rests not only on the assumption that one is dependent on the knowledge of others who are more knowledgeable; it also entails a vigilance toward the risk to be misinformed. Drawing on empirical findings, we argue that the critical characteristics that determine the epistemic trustworthiness of a source of science-based information (for example, a scientist or a scientific institution) are the source’s expertise, integrity and benevolence. These characteristics have already been described in the model of trust provided by Mayer et al. (1995), but when it comes to trust in context of science, they must be redefined. Furthermore, trust judgments are not based solely on these characteristics, but depend on further constrains, which will be discussed in this chapter.","author":[{"family":"Hendriks","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Kienhues","given":"Dorothe"},{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"hendriksTrustScienceScience2016","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-28059-2_8","ISBN":"978-3-319-28059-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,25]]},"page":"143-159","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Trust in Science and the Science of Trust","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"hennesMotivatedRecallService2016","abstract":"The contemporary political landscape is characterized by numerous divisive issues. Unlike many other issues, however, much of the disagreement about climate change centers not on how best to take action to address the problem, but on whether the problem exists at all. Psychological studies indicate that, to the extent that sustainability initiatives are seen as threatening to the socioeconomic system, individuals may downplay environmental problems in order to defend and protect the status quo. In the current research, participants were presented with scientific information about climate change and later asked to recall details of what they had learned. Individuals who were experimentally induced (Study 1) or dispositionally inclined (Studies 2 and 3) to justify the economic system misremembered the evidence to be less serious, and this was associated with increased skepticism. However, when high system justifiers were led to believe that the economy was in a recovery, they recalled climate change information to be more serious than did those assigned to a control condition. When low system justifiers were led to believe that the economy was in recession, they recalled the information to be less serious (Study 3). These findings suggest that, because system justification can impact information processing, simply providing the public with scientific evidence may be insufficient to inspire action to mitigate climate change. However, linking environmental information to statements about the strength of the economic system may satiate system justification needs and break the psychological link between pro-environmental initiatives and economic risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hennes","given":"Erin P."},{"family":"Ruisch","given":"Benjamin C."},{"family":"Feygina","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Monteiro","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"hennesMotivatedRecallService2016","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","DOI":"10.1037/xge0000148","ISSN":"1939-2222, 0096-3445","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/open-access.aspx","page":"755-771","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Motivated recall in the service of the economic system: The case of anthropogenic climate change.","title-short":"Motivated recall in the service of the economic system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xge0000148","volume":"145"},

A semi-structured interview was conducted concerning important autobiographical events. Overall, results indicated that differing levels of cultural religiosity (i.e., whether participants were from the relatively religious USA or the relatively secular UK) did not affect the tendency to reason teleologically. As predicted, explicit religious beliefs had an effect in that atheists gave significantly fewer teleological explanations than theists; however, half the atheists (n=17) gave at least one teleological response and more than three-quarters (n=26) gave a teleological response or admitted feeling conflicted between teleological intuitions and more rational, naturalistic explanations for significant life events.

This article tries to understand the evolution controversy by reframing it as a phenomenon of public understanding of science. Three paradigms were used as hypotheses for the rejection of evolution by Dutch Protestant Christians: knowledge deficit, attitude deficit and trust deficit. Ten Dutch Protestants rejecting evolution were interviewed about their views concerning evolution and science. It was found that the main reason for rejecting evolution was an a priori decision to trust the Bible more than science. Any views on science and evolution were based on this decision, so all three hypotheses, which suggest an a posteriori decision, were found to be not sufficient to explain the rejection of evolution, even though both a knowledge deficit and a trust deficit were found for some participants. However, all respondents felt that their a priori decision was supported by scientific facts. All respondents stated that evolution does not meet the criteria for good science and is therefore as unscientific as the belief in creation. Excluding evolution from science allows the respondents to retain their positive attitudes towards science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hildering","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Consoli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Born","given":"Riyan","non-dropping-particle":"van den"}],"citation-key":"hilderingDenyingDarwinViews2013","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662512437328","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"988-998","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Denying Darwin: Views on science in the rejection of evolution by Dutch Protestants","title-short":"Denying Darwin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662512437328","volume":"22"},

From a sample of 732 scientific abstracts drawn from the climate change literature, we find that articles with more narrative abstracts are cited more often.

Study 1 (<italic>N =</italic> 798) established the construct validity of the scale, and revealed four distinct existential threats: personal death (PD), physical collective annihilation (PA), symbolic collective annihilation (SA), and past victimization (PV). Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 424) confirmed the 4-factor structure, and the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale. Study 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 170) revealed that the association between a hawkish political ideology and support for hardline policies was mediated by PV, whereas the association between a dovish political ideology and conciliatory policies was mediated by concerns over collective symbolic annihilation. Study 4 (<italic>N</italic> = 503) conceptually replicated the pattern of findings found in Study 3, and showed that at times of conflict, PA concerns also mediate the relationship between hawkish ideologies and support for hardline policies. In both Studies 3 and 4, when controlling for other threats, PD did not play a significant role. These results underscore the need to consider the multidimensional nature of existential threat, especially in the context of political conflict.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirschberger","given":"Gilad"},{"family":"Ein-Dor","given":"Tsachi"},{"family":"Leidner","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Saguy","given":"Tamar"}],"citation-key":"hirschbergerHowExistentialThreat2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"hoferDimensionalityDisciplinaryDifferences2000","abstract":"A growing body of work addresses the nature of epistemological development and epistemological beliefs: how individuals come to know, the theories and beliefs they hold about knowing, and the manner in which such epistemological premises are a part of and an influence on the cognitive processes of thinking and reasoning. This study investigates the dimensionality of personal epistemology as hypothesized in a recent review of the literature as well as the nature of disciplinary differences. First-year college students responded to a set of questionnaires that included an adaptation of a domain-general epistemological instrument and a discipline-focused questionnaire. Results suggest that there is an underlying dimensionality to epistemological theories that cuts across disciplinary domains, but that students, at least by the 1st year of college, discriminate as to how these theories differ by discipline. Disciplinary differences were strong, suggesting that 1st-year college students see knowledge in science as more certain and unchanging than in psychology, are more likely to regard personal knowledge and firsthand experience as a basis for justification of knowing in psychology than in science, view authority and expertise as the source of knowledge more in science than in psychology, and perceive that in science, more than in psychology, truth is attainable by experts. This contradicts existing research that suggests that epistemological development is domain general and that epistemological beliefs do not differ by discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofer","given":"Barbara K."}],"citation-key":"hoferDimensionalityDisciplinaryDifferences2000","container-title":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","container-title-short":"Contemporary Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1006/ceps.1999.1026","ISSN":"0361-476X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",10,1]]},"page":"378-405","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dimensionality and Disciplinary Differences in Personal Epistemology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X99910263","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"hoffmanItsNotAll2019","abstract":"Background: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were conﬁrmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.\nMethods: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The ﬁnal codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen’s j ranged 0.71–1.0 after double-coding.\nResults: The majority (89%) of individuals identiﬁed as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as ‘‘trust,” ‘‘alternatives,” ‘‘safety,” and ‘‘conspiracy.” For example, a comment representative of ‘‘conspiracy” is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the ‘‘alternatives” sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals’ proﬁles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water ﬂuoridation and circumcision.\nConclusions: Social media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, targeted messages to different constituencies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Beth L."},{"family":"Felter","given":"Elizabeth M."},{"family":"Chu","given":"Kar-Hai"},{"family":"Shensa","given":"Ariel"},{"family":"Hermann","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Wolynn","given":"Todd"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Primack","given":"Brian A."}],"citation-key":"hoffmanItsNotAll2019","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.003","ISSN":"0264410X","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"2216-2223","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"It’s not all about autism: The emerging landscape of anti-vaccination sentiment on Facebook","title-short":"It’s not all about autism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X19303032","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"hoggUncertaintyIdentityTheory2007","abstract":"While I write this chapter, millions of people in the Darfur province of Sudan have been terrorized off their land; the entire population of Iraq has little idea what the future of their country will be; survivors of hurricane Katrina are dispersed across the United States; people in Britain are anxious about immigration and are toying with the idea of supporting the British National Party; people in a small town in Tasmania wait to hear if members of their community have been found alive in a mine collapse; air travelers the world over have no idea what new security arrangements await them when they get to the airport; and we all wonder about the consequences of further escalation in the price of oil and of the standoff over Iran's uranium enrichment program. The world is an uncertain place, it always has been, and these uncertainties can make it very difficult to predict or plan our lives and to feel sure about the type of people we are. In this chapter, I describe how feelings of uncertainty, particularly about or related to self, motivate people to identify with social groups and to choose new groups with, or configure existing groups to have, certain properties that best reduce, control, or protect from feelings of uncertainty. I consider this uncertainty–identity theory to be a development of the motivational component of social identity theory. It addresses why, when, and how strongly people identify with groups, and why groups may have particular generic properties in certain contexts. Of particular relevance to contemporary postmodern society, uncertainty reduction theory provides an account of zealotry and the cult of the “true believer” in the thrall of ideology and powerful leadership—an account of conditions that may spawn extremism, a silo mentality, and a loss of moral or ethical perspective. In this chapter, I describe uncertainty–identity theory and some conceptual elaborations and applications, review direct and indirect empirical tests, and locate the theory in the context of related ideas and theories in social psychology. I start with a historical sketch of why, when, and how uncertainty–identity theory was developed, then go on to discuss uncertainty reduction as a motivation for human behavior. I then detail the process by which group identification reduces uncertainty and describe a program of studies showing that people who feel uncertain are more likely to identify and identify more strongly with groups. High‐entitativity groups are best equipped to reduce uncertainty through identification—entitativity moderates the uncertainty–identification relation. I discuss this idea and describe research that supports it, and then extend the analysis to deal with extremism and totalistic groups—describing how extreme uncertainty may encourage strong identification (zealotry, fanaticism, being a true believer) with groups that are structured in a totalistic fashion. Again I describe some research supporting this idea. The next section deals with extensions, applications, and implications of uncertainty–identity theory. I discuss the relation between depersonalization and self‐projection processes in uncertainty‐motivated group identification, and then, in a subsection entitled central members, marginal members, leaders, and deviants, I focus on the role of group prototypicality in uncertainty reduction processes. The role of trust, the relation between uncertainty, identity, and ideology, and the role of uncertainty in social mobilization are also discussed. The final section, before concluding comments, discusses other theories, approaches, and topics that deal with constructs related to those discussed by uncertainty–identity theory. Specifically, I discuss uncertainty as a state versus a trait, with a focus on the constructs of need for cognitive closure and uncertainty orientation; the role played by culture in uncertainty; and the relevance of terror management, compensatory conviction, self‐verification, and system justification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hogg","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"hoggUncertaintyIdentityTheory2007","container-title":"Advances in Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/S0065-2601(06)39002-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"69-126","publisher":"Academic Press","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Uncertainty–Identity Theory","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260106390028","volume":"39"},

It also compares the different positions of the students to that of the course instructor. Questionnaires and semistructured interviews were used to collect data. Qualitative methods were used to analyze the data and identify the various positions of the students and course instructor. The students' positions ranged from complete acceptance to complete rejection of the theory of evolution.

In a large and diverse cross-cultural sample (N = 10,195 from 24 countries), we presented participants with obscure, meaningless statements attributed to either a spiritual guru or a scientist. We found a robust global source credibility effect for scientific authorities, which we dub ‘the Einstein effect’: across all 24 countries and all levels of religiosity, scientists held greater authority than spiritual gurus. In addition, individual religiosity predicted a weaker relative preference for the statement from the scientist compared with the spiritual guru, and was more strongly associated with credibility judgements for the guru than the scientist. Independent data on explicit trust ratings across 143 countries mirrored our experimental findings.

Here, we adopted a many-analysts approach to assess the robustness of this relation based on a new cross-cultural dataset (N=10,535 participants from 24 countries). We recruited 120 analysis teams to investigate (1) whether religious people self-report higher well-being, and (2) whether the relation between religiosity and self-reported well-being depends on perceived cultural norms of religion (i.e., whether it is considered normal and desirable to be religious in a given country). In a two-stage procedure, the teams first created an analysis plan and then executed their planned analysis on the data. For the first research question, all but 3 teams reported positive effect sizes with credible/confidence intervals excluding zero (median reported beta = 0.120). For the second research question, this was the case for 65% of the teams (median reported beta = 0.039).

In this Review, we synthesize the literature with an eye to understanding the psychological factors that shape willingness to believe conspiracy theories. We begin at the individual level, examining the cognitive, clinical, motivational, personality and developmental factors that predispose people to believe conspiracy theories. Drawing on insights from social and evolutionary psychology, we then review research examining conspiracy theories as an intergroup phenomenon that reflects and reinforces societal fault lines. Finally, we examine how conspiracy theories are shaped by the economic, political, cultural and socio-historical contexts at the national level. This multilevel approach offers a deep and broad insight into conspiracist thinking that increases understanding of the problem and offers potential solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hornsey","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Bierwiaczonek","given":"Kinga"},{"family":"Sassenberg","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Karen M."}],"citation-key":"hornseyIndividualIntergroupNationlevel2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Psychology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Psychol","DOI":"10.1038/s44159-022-00133-0","ISSN":"2731-0574","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"2","page":"85-97","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Individual, intergroup and nation-level influences on belief in conspiracy theories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00133-0","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"hornseyPsychologicalRootsAntivaccination2018","abstract":"Objective: Strengthening of antivaccination movements in recent decades has coincided with unprecedented increases in the incidence of some communicable diseases. Many intervention programs work from a deficit model of science communication, presuming that vaccination skeptics lack the ability to access or understand evidence. However, interventions focusing on evidence and the debunking of vaccine-related myths have proven to be either nonproductive or counterproductive. Working from a motivated reasoning perspective, we examine the psychological factors that might motivate people to reject scientific consensus around vaccination. To assist with international generalizability, we examine this question in 24 countries. Methods: We sampled 5,323 participants in 24 countries, and measured their antivaccination attitudes. We also measured their belief in conspiracy theories, reactance (the tendency for people to have a low tolerance for impingements on their freedoms), disgust sensitivity toward blood and needles, and individualistic/hierarchical worldviews (i.e., people’s beliefs about how much control society should have over individuals, and whether hierarchies are desirable). Results: In order of magnitude, antivaccination attitudes were highest among those who (a) were high in conspiratorial thinking, (b) were high in reactance, (c) reported high levels of disgust toward blood and needles, and (d) had strong individualistic/hierarchical worldviews. In contrast, demographic variables (including education) accounted for nonsignificant or trivial levels of variance. Conclusions: These data help identify the “attitude roots” that may motivate and sustain vaccine skepticism. In so doing, they help shed light on why repetition of evidence can be nonproductive, and suggest communication solutions to that problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hornsey","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Fielding","given":"Kelly S."}],"citation-key":"hornseyPsychologicalRootsAntivaccination2018","container-title":"Health Psychology","container-title-short":"Health Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/hea0000586","ISSN":"1930-7810, 0278-6133","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"307-315","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The psychological roots of anti-vaccination attitudes: A 24-nation investigation.","title-short":"The psychological roots of anti-vaccination attitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/hea0000586","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"howardPersistenceDefiningMultidimensional2019","abstract":"Persistence is often viewed as a behavioral event, whereby a person works through obstacles in the pursuit of a goal. This operationalization does not speak to persistence as an individual difference, but many researchers have observed people for which persistence appears habitual and is applied in the pursuit of all goals broadly. We suggest that several closely related constructs, such as grit and perseverance, may partially capture multiple dimensions of the overall construct of persistence. These dimensions are Persistence Despite Difficulties (PDD), Persistence Despite Fear (PDF), and Inappropriate Persistence (IP). In an initial study, we show that these three dimensions emerge in multiple measures for these closely related constructs, along with the construct of Goal Time Preference (GTP). Then, we create the Multidimensional Persistence Scale through a three-study process, showing that the scale has satisfactory psychometric properties and validity, and we support our three-dimensional conceptualization of persistence. Lastly, in two studies, we demonstrate that the three dimensions of persistence have notable and distinct relationships with personal well-being; however, only PDD appears to significantly influence organizational outcomes, supported through its significant relationship with organizational citizenship behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Matt C."},{"family":"Crayne","given":"Matthew P."}],"citation-key":"howardPersistenceDefiningMultidimensional2019","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2018.11.005","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"77-89","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Persistence: Defining the multidimensional construct and creating a measure","title-short":"Persistence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918305993","volume":"139"},

  {"id":"huberCentralityReligiosityScale2012","abstract":"The Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS) is a measure of the centrality, importance or salience of religious meanings in personality that has been applied yet in more than 100 studies in sociology of religion, psychology of religion and religious studies in 25 countries with in total more than 100,000 participants. It measures the general intensities of five theoretical defined core dimensions of religiosity. The dimensions of public practice, private practice, religious experience, ideology and the intellectual dimensions can together be considered as representative for the total of religious live. From a psychological perspective, the five core-dimensions can be seen as channels or modes in which personal religious constructs are shaped and activated. The activation of religious constructs in personality can be regarded as a valid measure of the degree of religiosity of an individual. The CRS thus derives from the five dimensional measures a combined measure of the centrality of religiosity which is suitable also for interreligious studies. The paper presents the theoretical basis and rationale of its construction with different versions of the CRS in 20 languages with norm values for 21 countries. Furthermore, the paper presents versions of different extension and describes specific modifications that were developed for studies with Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Odilo W."}],"citation-key":"huberCentralityReligiosityScale2012","container-title":"Religions","DOI":"10.3390/rel3030710","ISSN":"2077-1444","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"710-724","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/3/3/710","volume":"3"},

Specifically, we focused on trait psychopathy, Machiavellianism and collective narcissism, as these traits have previously been linked to heightened conspiracy mentalities. We recruited 406 UK participants to take part in an online survey investigating personality and Covid-19 information. Machiavellianism and primary psychopathy positively predicted general and Covid specific conspiracy beliefs, whereas collective narcissism positively predicted Covid specific conspiracy beliefs only.

We propose that religious centrality of beliefs vs. practices influences attitudes toward atheists, such that religious groups emphasizing beliefs perceive non-believers more negatively than believers, while groups emphasizing practices perceive non-practicing individuals more negatively than practicing individuals. Studies 1-2, in surveys of 41 countries, found that Muslims and Protestants (belief-oriented) had more negative attitudes toward atheists than did Jews and Hindus (practice-oriented). Study 3 experimentally manipulated a target individual’s beliefs and practices. Protestants had more negative attitudes toward a non-believer (vs. a believer), whereas Jews had more negative attitudes toward a non-practicing individual (vs. a practicing individual, particularly when they had a Jewish background). This research has implications for the psychology of religion, anti-atheist prejudice, and cross-cultural attitudes regarding where dissent in beliefs or practices may be tolerated or censured within religious groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Grossmann","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Adam B."}],"citation-key":"hughesToleratingDoubtingThomas2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Against this background, this study investigated the role of motivated reasoning and numeracy in the context of the current pandemic. To this end, participants (N = 417; US sample) evaluated two fictitious studies, one indicating that mask mandates in schools are an effective intervention to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and one indicating that mask mandates in schools are counterproductive. Participants evaluated the studies in line with their prior attitude toward mask mandates. In addition, higher numeracy was associated with decreased bias, demonstrating that the ability to reason with numbers can lead to more accurate processing of statistical information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hutmacher","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Reichardt","given":"Regina"},{"family":"Appel","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"hutmacherRoleMotivatedScience2022","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/09636625211047974","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"19-34","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The role of motivated science reception and numeracy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625211047974","volume":"31"},

In the first set, the digital text analysis tool, Voyant, is used to analyze all papers published in 2014 for the use of epistemic success terms. In the second set of data, all papers published in Public Understanding of Science from 2010?2015 are systematically analyzed to identify instances in which epistemic states are empirically measured. The results indicate that epistemic success terms are inconsistently defined, and that measurement of understanding, in particular, is rarely achieved in public understanding of science studies.

Where governments and economies function poorly, sects often become major suppliers of social services, political action, and coercive force. Their success as providers is much more due to the advantages of their organizational structure than it is to their theology.

  {"id":"idlerSecularizationAgeRelatedProcess2022","abstract":"Secularization has been studied for decades by sociologists of religion. Long-running surveys in the United States and Europe show steady generational decline in religious affiliation and participation, and yet this trend has largely been ignored by gerontologists and life course researchers. We examined data from the Health and Retirement Study, hypothesizing between-cohort declines in religious participation. Based on data from a sample stratified by 10-year birth cohorts, we identified variation in patterns of religious involvement from 2004 to 2016. Measures of attending religious services, feeling religion is very important, and having good friends in the congregation show age-graded patterns; older cohorts have a higher level of religiosity than those following them, with only minor exceptions. For all three measures, differences by cohort within waves of data are statistically significant. We confirm, with longitudinal data, the findings of repeated cross-sectional surveys in the United States showing a generational pattern of decline in religiousness. The consequences of this loss of a common social tie for future older cohorts are unknown, since current older cohorts still maintain a high level of religious participation. However, future generations of older adults are likely to be less familiar with social support from religious institutions, and those institutions may be less available to provide such support as the apparently inexorable processes of secularization continue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Idler","given":"Ellen"}],"citation-key":"idlerSecularizationAgeRelatedProcess2022","container-title":"The International Journal of Aging and Human Development","container-title-short":"Int J Aging Hum Dev","DOI":"10.1177/00914150211027547","ISSN":"0091-4150","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"page":"8-22","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Is Secularization an Age-Related Process?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00914150211027547","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"ihmAweMeaningMakingEmotion2019","abstract":"The psychology of meaning offers an integrative framework for studying religions alongside other systems of belief and practice. Theories of psychological meaning focus on the maintenance and updating of coherent systems of perceptions, beliefs, values and goals, known as meaning systems, in the service of goal-directed action. Meaning systems also provide individuals with a sense of meaning in life (MIL), which appears to serve as a subjective indicator that meaning systems are tuned for effective action in the world. When meaning systems are challenged, they may be stabilized and updated through processes of meaning maintenance and meaning-making. This chapter focuses on experiences of awe, which feature prominently in both religious and nonreligious meaning systems. In particular, awe seems to be involved in updating meaning systems in response to stimuli that cannot be readily assimilated to existing schemas. An awe-like state also appears to be present in chimpanzees in response to birth, death and powerful natural displays. This suggests that such a state may have been present in our hominid ancestors as far back as five to eight million years ago. Chimpanzees also display a number of social cognitive faculties that may be considered building blocks of religions, including community-level organization and a rudimentary capacity for cultural invention and transmission. The cognitive science of religion may benefit from considering how these elements were organized within the shared meaning systems that eventually gave rise to modern religions and secular meaning systems.","author":[{"family":"Ihm","given":"Elliott D."},{"family":"Paloutzian","given":"Raymond F."},{"family":"Elk","given":"Michiel","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schooler","given":"Jonathan W."}],"citation-key":"ihmAweMeaningMakingEmotion2019","container-title":"The Evolution of Religion, Religiosity and Theology","ISBN":"978-0-429-28560-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"16","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Awe as a Meaning-Making Emotion: On the Evolution of Awe and the Origin of Religions","title-short":"Awe as a Meaning-Making Emotion","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"imhoffTearingApartEvil2022","abstract":"Although sometimes used interchangeably, the present review highlights the important differences between generalized worldviews suspecting conspiracy at play (conspiracy mentality) and specific beliefs about the existence of a certain conspiracy (conspiracy theory). In contrast to measures of beliefs in specific conspiracy theories, those of conspiracy mentality are more stable, less malleable, less skewed in their distribution and less contaminated by other ideological content. These differences have important implications for empirical research and the theorizing of conspiracy beliefs. Building on an analogy of personality traits, we argue that conspiracy mentality is a relatively stable readiness to interpret world events as being caused by plots hatched in secret, whereas specific conspiracy beliefs are then manifest indicators (partially contaminated by other dispositions).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Imhoff","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Bertlich","given":"Tisa"},{"family":"Frenken","given":"Marius"}],"citation-key":"imhoffTearingApartEvil2022","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2022.101349","ISSN":"2352-250X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101349","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Tearing apart the “evil” twins: A general conspiracy mentality is not the same as specific conspiracy beliefs","title-short":"Tearing apart the “evil” twins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X22000689","volume":"46"},

Across three studies, we establish a modest but robust association between the self-attributed need for uniqueness and a general conspirational mindset (conspiracy mentality) as well as the endorsement of speciﬁc conspiracy beliefs. Following up on previous ﬁndings that people high in need for uniqueness resist majority and yield to minority inﬂuence, Study 3 experimentally shows that a ﬁctitious conspiracy theory received more support by people high in conspiracy mentality when this theory was said to be supported by only a minority (vs. majority) of survey respondents. Together, these ﬁndings support the notion that conspiracy beliefs can be adopted as a means to attain a sense of uniqueness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Imhoff","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Lamberty","given":"Pia Karoline"}],"citation-key":"imhoffTooSpecialBe2017","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1002/ejsp.2265","ISSN":"00462772","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"language":"en","page":"724-734","source":"Crossref","title":"Too special to be duped: Need for uniqueness motivates conspiracy beliefs: Need for uniqueness and conspiracies","title-short":"Too special to be duped","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ejsp.2265","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"inzlichtNeedBelieveNeuroscience2011","abstract":"Religious belief has been shown to offer substantial benefits to its adherents, including improved well-being and health. We suggest that these benefits might be explained, at least in part, from a “motivated meaning-making” perspective. This model holds that people are motivated to create and sustain meaning (i.e., a sense of coherency between beliefs, goals, and perceptions of the environment, which provides individuals with the feeling that the world is an orderly place), and that religious beliefs buffer the distress associated with disruptions to meaning, thus leading to decreases in distress. We further propose that religion's palliative attributes can be measured at the level of the brain, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which produces a “distress signal” upon the detection of errors, conflict, and expectancy violation. Using a social neuroscience paradigm, we investigate four main predictions that arise from this model: (1) religion should be associated with activation in the ACC; (2) religion should decrease activation in the ACC; (3) this attenuation of ACC activity should be related to religion's ability to buffer bodily states of distress, and not to decreases in motivation, attention, or control; (4) religion should have these effects because it provides meaning and thus buffers people from uncertainty. All predictions were supported, thus providing evidence, at the neural level, for the motivated meaning-making model's account of the salutary properties of religion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Inzlicht","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tullett","given":"Alexa M."},{"family":"Good","given":"Marie"}],"citation-key":"inzlichtNeedBelieveNeuroscience2011","container-title":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/2153599X.2011.647849","ISSN":"2153-599X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10,1]]},"page":"192-212","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The need to believe: a neuroscience account of religion as a motivated process","title-short":"The need to believe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2011.647849","volume":"1"},

The programme encourages engagement that not only fosters science education and dissemination, but also promotes two-way dialogues between scientists and the public at various stages of research. Establishing such dialogues between different groups of societal actors is seen as crucial in order to attain epistemic as well as social desiderata at the intersection between science and society. However, whether these dialogues can actually help attaining these desiderata is far from obvious. This paper discusses some of the costs, risks, and benefits of dialogical public engagement practices, and proposes a strategy to analyse these argumentative practices based on a three-tiered model of epistemic exchange. As a case study, we discuss the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy, arguably a result of suboptimal public engagement, and show how the proposed model can shed new light on the problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ivani","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Dutilh Novaes","given":"Catarina"}],"citation-key":"ivaniPublicEngagementArgumentation2022","container-title":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Euro Jnl Phil Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s13194-022-00480-y","ISSN":"1879-4920","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,9]]},"language":"en","page":"54","source":"Springer Link","title":"Public engagement and argumentation in science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-022-00480-y","volume":"12"},

To date, efforts have centered on improving the content, accessibility, and delivery of scientific communications. Here we argue that in the current political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes. We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation, and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Iyengar","given":"Shanto"},{"family":"Massey","given":"Douglas S."}],"citation-key":"iyengarScientificCommunicationPosttruth2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1805868115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,16]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","page":"7656-7661","PMID":"30478050","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Scientific communication in a post-truth society","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7656","volume":"116"},

Five studies support our account. A pilot study uses a large representative sample of Americans to show that religious people perceive less conflict between science and religion than non-religious people. Studies 1-2 show that religious people view religion and science as equally and moderately instrumental for explaining extraordinary events (Study 1) and life’s “big questions” (Study 2), whereas non-religious people view science as highly instrumental and religion as not at all so. Study 3 finds that non-religious people mischaracterize religious people as more reliant on religion and less reliant on science than they really are, and also suggests that religious people view science and religion as orthogonal whereas non-religious people view them as hydraulic.

Key results hold controlling for other technological developments (e.g., electricity grid access and telecommunications development), socioeconomic indicators (e.g., wealth, residential mobility, and demographics), and factors implicated in previous theories of religious decline (e.g., individual choice norms).

Although the existence of religious belief has been a human constant, the nature and prevalence of religion has changed dramatically throughout human history. Here we describe the emerging science of religious change. We first outline a multilevel framework for studying religious change drawn from theories of socioecological psychology and cultural evolution. We illustrate this framework with four case studies featuring two ancient religious changes (the rise of punitive religions and doctrinal rituals) and two modern religious changes (the rise of atheism and nontraditional religions). We then review useful methods for examining religious change, including ethnographic coding, agent-based modeling, and time-series analysis. Next, we explore future directions, highlighting the need for predictive forecasts, nonlinear models, and non-Western samples. We also outline ten key questions that need to be answered for a fuller understanding of religious change.

Some theories claim that religion encourages conflict with science by narrowing people’s worldviews, whereas others claim that religious people combine insights from science and religion to understand the world.

Studies 1-2 test a compatibility hypothesis that religious people should perceive less conflict between science and religion than non-religious people. We support this hypothesis in the U.S. (Study 1) and in a 38-nation sample (Study 2). Studies 3-6 test an instrumentality hypothesis that religious people should view science and religion as each moderately instrumental, whereas non-religious people should view science as extremely instrumental and religion as not at all instrumental. We support this hypothesis by analyzing how people explain extraordinary phenomena (Study 3), answer “life’s big questions” (Study 4), and avoid infection during COVID-19 (Study 5). Our studies also show that non-religious people underestimate religious people’s trust in science, and view science and religion as more mutually exclusive than do religious people (Study 6).

We translate this “instrumentality hypothesis” to differences in how religious and non-religious people perceive science and religion. Religious people—who use both science and religion as means to gain knowledge—may perceive both as moderately instrumental, and as less instrumental than non-religious people, who do not use religion as a source of knowledge. We support the instrumentality hypothesis in studies where participants evaluate the capacity of science and religion to explain extraordinary phenomena (Study 1), fill gaps in knowledge (Study 2), answer life’s big questions (Study 3), and to help avoid COVID-19 infection (Study 4). We also find that non-religious people overperceive religious people’s trust in religion and underperceive religious people’s trust in science as sources of knowledge (Study 5). Our studies suggest that non-religious people think that religion specifically deters trust in science, but instead, religious people typically avoid extreme epistemic reliance on any single source of knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Joshua Conrad"},{"family":"Jasko","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Abrams","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Balkcom","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Halberstadt","given":"Jamin"}],"citation-key":"jacksonReligiousPeopleView2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/536w7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,19]]},"language":"en-us","publisher":"OSF","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"Religious People View Both Science and Religion as Less Epistemically Valuable Than Non-Religious People View Science","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/536w7/"},

This article explores whether cultural groups invoke the supernatural more to explain natural phenomena (for example, storms, disease outbreaks) or social phenomena (for example, murder, warfare). Quantitative analysis of ethnographic text across 114 geographically and culturally diverse societies found that supernatural explanations are more prevalent for natural than for social phenomena, consistent with theories that ground the origin of religious belief in a human tendency to perceive intent and agency in the natural world. Despite the dominance of supernatural explanations of natural phenomena, supernatural explanations of social phenomena were especially prevalent in urbanized societies with more socially complex and anonymous groups. Our results show how people use supernatural beliefs as explanatory tools in non-industrial societies, and how these applications vary across small-scale communities versus large and urbanized groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Joshua Conrad"},{"family":"Dillion","given":"Danica"},{"family":"Bastian","given":"Brock"},{"family":"Watts","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Buckner","given":"William"},{"family":"DiMaggio","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"}],"citation-key":"jacksonSupernaturalExplanations1142023","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","container-title-short":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-023-01558-0","ISSN":"2397-3374","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","page":"1-11","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Supernatural explanations across 114 societies are more common for natural than social phenomena","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01558-0"},
  {"id":"jacksonTightCulturesVengeful2021","abstract":"Billions of people from around the world believe in vengeful gods who punish immoral behavior. These punitive religious beliefs may foster prosociality and contribute to large-scale cooperation, but little is known about how these beliefs emerge and why people adopt them in the ﬁrst place. We present a culturalpsychological model suggesting that cultural tightness—the strictness of cultural norms and normative punishment—helps to catalyze punitive religious beliefs by increasing people’s motivation to punish norm violators. Our model also suggests that tightness mediates the impact of ecological threat on punitive belief, explaining why punitive religious beliefs are most common in regions with high levels of ecological threat. Five multimethod studies support these predictions. Studies 1–3 focus on the effect of cultural tightness on punitive religious beliefs. Historical increases in cultural tightness precede and predict historical increases in punitive beliefs (Study 1), and both manipulating people’s support for tightness (Study 2) and placing people in a simulated tight society (Study 3) increase punitive religious beliefs via the personal motivation to punish norm violators. Studies 4–5 focus on whether cultural tightness mediates the link between ecological threat and punitive religious beliefs. Cultural tightness helps explain why U.S. states with high ecological threat (e.g., natural hazards, scarcity) have the highest levels of punitive religious beliefs (Study 4) and why experimental manipulations of threat increase punitive religious beliefs (Study 5).

  {"id":"jacquetPredictiveMultivariateModelling2020","abstract":"Why do moral religions exist? An influential explanation is that religious beliefs in supernatural punishment is cultural group adaptation enhancing prosocial attitudes and thereby large-scale cooperation. An alternative explanation is that religiosity is an individual strategy that results from high level of mistrust and the need for individuals to control others’ behaviours through moralizing. Existing evidence is mixed but most works are limited by sample size and generalizability issues. The present study overcomes these limitations by applying k-fold cross-validation on multivariate modelling of data from more than 295,000 individuals in 108 countries of the World Values Surveys and the European Value Study. This methodology demonstrates that in European as well as in non-European samples, religious people invest less in collective actions and are more mistrustful of others. By contrast, we find a strong and positive association between higher level of mistrust, higher level of moralizing and higher level of religiosity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacquet","given":"Pierre O."},{"family":"Pazhoohi","given":"Farid"},{"family":"Findling","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Mell","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Chevallier","given":"Coralie"},{"family":"Baumard","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"jacquetPredictiveMultivariateModelling2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/hvpgq","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,3]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Predictive multivariate modelling of religiosity, prosociality and moralizing in 295,000 individuals from European and non-European populations","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/hvpgq"},

Identifying social factors for vaccine uptake enables targeted interventions to reduce health inequalities.\nObjective\nTo systematically appraise and quantify social factors associated with vaccine uptake amongst individuals aged ≥60years from Europe.\nMethods\nWe searched Medline and Embase from inception to 24/02/2016. The association of vaccine uptake was examined for social factors relevant at an individual level, to provide insight into individuals’ environment and enable development of targeted interventions by healthcare providers to deliver equitable healthcare. Factors included: living alone, marital status, education, income, vaccination costs, area-level deprivation, social class, urban versus rural residence, immigration status and religion. Between-study heterogeneity for each factor was identified using I2-statistics and Q-statistics, and investigated by stratification and meta-regression analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted, when appropriate, using fixed- or random-effects models.\nResults\nFrom 11,754 titles, 35 eligible studies were identified (uptake of: seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) only (n=27) or including pneumococcal vaccine (PV) (n=5); herpes zoster vaccine (n=1); pandemic influenza vaccine (n=1); PV only (n=1)). Higher SIV uptake was reported for individuals not living alone (summary odds ratios (OR)=1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16–1.68). Lower SIV uptake was observed in immigrants and in more deprived areas: summary OR=0.57 (95%CI: 0.47–0.68) and risk ratio=0.93 (95%CI: 0.92–0.94) respectively. Higher SIV uptake was associated with higher income (OR=1.26 (95%CI: 1.08–1.47)) and higher education (OR=1.05 (95%CI: 1–1.11)) in adequately adjusted studies. Between-study heterogeneity did not appear to result from variation in categorisation of social factors, but for education was partly explained by varying vaccination costs (meta-regression analysis p=<0.0001); individuals with higher education had higher vaccine uptake in countries without free vaccination.\nConclusions\nQuantification of associations between social factors and lower vaccine uptake, and notably living alone (an overlooked factor in vaccination programmes), should enable health professionals target specific social groups to tackle vaccine-related inequalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jain","given":"Anu"},{"family":"Hoek","given":"A.

  {"id":"jarrettStrategiesAddressingVaccine2015","abstract":"The purpose of this systematic review is to identify, describe and assess the potential effectiveness of strategies to respond to issues of vaccine hesitancy that have been implemented and evaluated across diverse global contexts.\nMethods\nA systematic review of peer reviewed (January 2007–October 2013) and grey literature (up to October 2013) was conducted using a broad search strategy, built to capture multiple dimensions of public trust, confidence and hesitancy concerning vaccines. This search strategy was applied and adapted across several databases and organizational websites. Descriptive analyses were undertaken for 166 (peer reviewed) and 15 (grey literature) evaluation studies. In addition, the quality of evidence relating to a series of PICO (population, intervention, comparison/control, outcomes) questions defined by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy (WG) was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria; data were analyzed using Review Manager.\nResults\nAcross the literature, few strategies to address vaccine hesitancy were found to have been evaluated for impact on either vaccination uptake and/or changes in knowledge, awareness or attitude (only 14% of peer reviewed and 25% of grey literature). The majority of evaluation studies were based in the Americas and primarily focused on influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV) and childhood vaccines. In low- and middle-income regions, the focus was on diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, and polio. Across all regions, most interventions were multi-component and the majority of strategies focused on raising knowledge and awareness. Thirteen relevant studies were used for the GRADE assessment that indicated evidence of moderate quality for the use of social mobilization, mass media, communication tool-based training for health-care workers, non-financial incentives and reminder/recall-based interventions. Overall, our results showed that multicomponent and dialogue-based interventions were most effective. However, given the complexity of vaccine hesitancy and the limited evidence available on how it can be addressed, identified strategies should be carefully tailored according to the target population, their reasons for hesitancy, and the specific context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jarrett","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rose"},{"family":"O’Leary","given":"Maureen"},{"family":"Eckersberger","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Larson","given":"Heidi J."}],"citation-key":"jarrettStrategiesAddressingVaccine2015","collection-title":"WHO Recommendations Regarding Vaccine Hesitancy","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.040","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"34","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,14]]},"language":"en","page":"4180-4190","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy – A systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15005046","volume":"33"},

Consistent with emerging research into antisemitism and anti-Zionism, there was a positive association between both forms of prejudice, suggesting social psychological overlap between the constructs. Given the pervasiveness of antisemitic and anti-Zionist representations in Iran, there were no significant differences in levels of anti-Zionism or antisemitism on the basis of gender and educational orientations. Political conservatives did manifest greater antisemitism and anti-Zionism than political reformists, although both groups scored high on these scales. There was a significant interaction effect of Iranian national identity and political trust on anti-Zionism, and a significant interaction effect of Muslim religious identity and political trust on antisemitism. Political trust was by far the most powerful predictor of both forms of prejudice, followed by the perception of identity threat.

Our analysis uses Bayesian networks to characterize different kinds of relationships between hypotheses and data, and distinguishes between cases in which normative reasoners with opposing beliefs should both strengthen their beliefs, cases in which both should weaken their beliefs, and cases in which one should strengthen and the other should weaken his or her belief. We apply our analysis to several previous studies of belief polarization and present a new experiment that suggests that people tend to update their beliefs in the directions predicted by our normative account.

  {"id":"jessegrahamBeliefsReligionsBind2010","abstract":"Social psychologists have often followed other scientists in treating religiosity primarily as a set of beliefs held by individuals. But, beliefs are only one facet of this complex and multidimensional construct. The authors argue that social psychology can best contribute to scholarship on religion by being relentlessly social. They begin with a social-functionalist approach in which beliefs, rituals, and other aspects of religious practice are best understood as means of creating a moral community. They discuss the ways that religion is intertwined with five moral foundations, in particular the group-focused “binding” foundations of Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, Purity/sanctity. The authors use this theoretical perspective to address three mysteries about religiosity, including why religious people are happier, why they are more charitable, and why most people in the world are religious.","author":[{"literal":"Jesse Graham"},{"literal":"Jonathan Haidt"}],"citation-key":"jessegrahamBeliefsReligionsBind2010","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1177/1088868309353415","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2163138441","PMID":"20089848","title":"Beyond Beliefs: Religions Bind Individuals Into Moral Communities","type":"article-journal"},

We provide evidence that high economic inequality may enhance conspiratorial thinking because, as a form of collective-level crisis, it undermines the social fabric of society and engenders anomie. We focus on the mechanism through which inequality should affect conspiratorial thinking by outlining how inequality enhances perceptions of anomie that, in turn, increase conspiratorial thinking. We end our contribution with the observation that it is by focusing on the sociostructural contexts that trigger conspiracy beliefs that we can more fully understand them.

However, thanks primarily to the long-standing personal interest of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan tradition he represents has come to engage deeply with various disciplines of modern science. This essay follows the active engagement that has occurred particularly in the form of the biannual Mind and Life dialogues between the Dalai Lama and scientists. From the perspective of an active participant, I present the careful deliberations that ensure constructive parameters for these dialogues so that no one side can exert a hegemonic voice. I explore the challenges that are likely to confront the Buddhist side from its encounter with science, particularly with respect to its worldview. I identify specific areas where the two sides can and do engage in concrete collaboration, especially with respect to investigating healthy qualities of the mind and the effects of conscious mental training for attention and emotion regulation.

Descriptive and normative ratings fell into extrinsic (money, fame, power, being liked, helping employer) and intrinsic (do good science, enjoy challenge, helping society and others) motivation factors; being independent and gaining respect were outliers. People saw intrinsic motivations as more common, but wanted intrinsic motivations to dominate extrinsic ones even more. Despite a few differences for extrinsic-motivation ratings, the lay public tended to see scientific work as similarly motivated regardless of the employer.

The most influential cues were majority vote, replication, information quality, and experience.

Such analyses have often suffered from poorly specified concepts related to religion and to science. At the individual level, scholars often assume that an individual’s religiosity will affect her orientation towards science. But an orientation towards science consists of several sub-concepts, each of which may have a unique relationship, or lack thereof, with religiosity. We use observed measures from the 2008 General Social Survey to build latent variables representing science orientation sub-concepts and assess their relationships using structural equation modeling. We find that religiosity has no significant association with interest in or knowledge of science. Religiosity does, however, have a significant negative association with confidence in science. This suggests that the lack of faith in science held by religious individuals is not a product of interest or ignorance, but is instead based on theological or institutional reservations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"David R."},{"family":"Scheitle","given":"Christopher P."},{"family":"Ecklund","given":"Elaine Howard"}],"citation-key":"johnsonIndividualReligiosityOrientation2015","container-title":"Sociological Science","DOI":"10.15195/v2.a7","ISSN":"2330-6696","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,11]]},"language":"en-US","page":"106-124","source":"sociologicalscience.com","title":"Individual Religiosity and Orientation towards Science: Reformulating Relationships","title-short":"Individual Religiosity and Orientation towards Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-vol2-7-106/","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"johnsonInteractionFaithScience2023","abstract":"Religion and Science are two cultural systems that have each played a critical role in shaping human thought, feelings, and behavior, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship between the two systems. Religion and Science may be viewed as conflicting (if one is right, the other is wrong), in dialogue (differences can be discussed and reasonably resolved), or as separate domains of inquiry. Researchers studying people's attitudes toward conflict and dialogue have focused on the main effects of religious or science-minded variables only. In contrast, we made predictions regarding an interaction effect: As faith scores increase, a positive relationship between science mindset and conflict would be attenuated (H1); and the negative relationship between science mindset and dialogue would also decrease (H2). Using a sample of 669 U.S. participants, we found support for the hypothesized interaction effect. Among participants high in faith mindset, science mindset was negatively related to conflict and positively related to dialogue. In contrast, among participants low in faith mindset, science mindset was positively related to conflict and negatively related to dialogue. Thus, it is important to consider the joint effects of faith and science mindsets when predicting views of the relationship between Religion and Science. We also explored the relationships between mindsets and Religion and Science as separate domains and found that mindsets accounted for minimal variance. We discuss how science and faith mindsets may each contribute to well-being but that endorsing a cultural narrative of Religion and Science in conflict may be detrimental to well-being.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Kathryn A."},{"family":"Okun","given":"Morris A."},{"family":"Moon","given":"Jordan W."}],"citation-key":"johnsonInteractionFaithScience2023","container-title":"Current Research in Ecological and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Research in Ecological and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100113","ISSN":"2666-6227","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"page":"100113","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The interaction of faith and science mindsets predicts perceptions of the relationship between religion and science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666622723000266","volume":"4"},

Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views.

We propose dual pathways whereby scientific engagement may have paradoxical effects on belief in God. Logical aspects of science, associated with analytical thinking, are associated with unbelief. However, people can also be awed by scientific information, and awe is associated with feelings of self-transcendence and belief in a mystical God. An exploratory study (supplemental material; N = 322) and Study 1 (N = 490) demonstrated that people interested in science often hold abstract (but not personal) representations of God. This effect was mediated by a predisposition to feel awe. In Studies 2 and 3 (combined N = 570), people experimentally exposed to awe-inspiring scientific content were more likely than control participants to endorse abstract God representations.

However, simpler explanations are not always normatively superior because they often do not account for the data as well as complex explanations. How do people negotiate this trade-off between prior probability (favoring simple explanations) and goodness-of-fit (favoring complex explanations)? Here, we argue that people use opponent heuristics to simplify this problem—that people use simplicity as a cue to prior probability but complexity as a cue to goodness-of-fit. Study 1 finds direct evidence for this claim. In subsequent studies, we examine factors that lead one or the other heuristic to predominate in a given context. Studies 2 and 3 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference in deterministic rather than stochastic contexts, while Studies 4 and 5 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference for physical rather than social causal systems, suggesting that people use abstract expectations about causal texture to modulate their explanatory inferences.

A pilot study (N = 98) found a positive relationship between conspiracy belief and satisfaction with the status quo. In Study 1 (N = 120), threatening (vs. affirming) the status quo in British society caused participants to endorse conspiracy theories.

Study 1 (N = 166) demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories concerning immigrants to Britain from the European Union (vs. anti-conspiracy material or a control) exacerbated prejudice towards this group. Study 2 (N = 173) found the same effect in a different intergroup context – exposure to conspiracy theories about Jewish people (vs. anti-conspiracy material or a control) increased prejudice towards this group and reduced participants’ willingness to vote for a Jewish political candidate. Finally, Study 3 (N = 114) demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories about Jewish people not only increased prejudice towards this group but was indirectly associated with increased prejudice towards a number of secondary outgroups (e.g., Asians, Arabs, Americans, Irish, Australians).

In two studies, participants were presented with anti-conspiracy arguments either before, or after reading arguments in favor of popular conspiracy theories concerning vaccination.

Findings revealed that belief in 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theories was positively correlated with state anger, which in turn, was associated with a greater justification of real-life and hypothetical violence in response to an alleged link between 5G mobile technology and COVID-19, alongside a greater intent to engage in similar behaviours in the future. Moreover, these associations were strongest for those highest in paranoia. Furthermore, we show that these patterns are not specific to 5G conspiratorial beliefs: General conspiracy mentality was positively associated with justification and willingness for general violence, an effect mediated by heightened state anger, especially for those most paranoid in the case of justification of violence. Such research provides novel evidence on why and when conspiracy beliefs may justify the use of violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jolley","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"Jenny L."}],"citation-key":"jolleyPylonsAblazeExamining2020","container-title":"British Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/bjso.12394","ISSN":"2044-8309","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 The Authors.

  {"id":"jonesHowCanWe2017","abstract":"The core goal of the science communicator is to convey accurate scientific information—to help people update existing understandings of the world and to change those understandings when necessary. However, science communicators, with their often extensive scientific training and educations, are often socialized into educating with information derived from scientific works in a way that mirrors the values of science itself. They do this by primarily relying on an approach termed the Knowledge Deficit Model, a model of communicating that emphasizes the repetition of emotionless objectively sterile information to increase understanding. The problem with this approach is that people do not actually make decisions or process information based on only objective scientific evidence. Their personal beliefs and emotional understandings of the world also play a powerful role. In this article we argue that to better connect with audiences communicators would do well to recognize themselves as storytellers–not to distort the truth, but to help people to connect with problems and issues on a more human level in terms of what matters to them. We reference extant narrative persuasion scholarship in public policy and elsewhere to offer a step-by-step guide to narrating scientific evidence. We argue that through understanding the structure of a narrative, science communicators can engage in the policy process, remaining true to the tenets of science and maintaining the integrity of the evidence, but doing so in a way that is compelling and thus also effective in helping solve problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Crow","given":"Deserai Anderson"}],"citation-key":"jonesHowCanWe2017","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","container-title-short":"Palgrave Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-017-0047-7","ISSN":"2055-1045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,22]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 The Author(s)","page":"1-9","source":"www.nature.com","title":"How can we use the ‘science of stories’ to produce persuasive scientific stories?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0047-7","volume":"3"},

Less attention has been paid, however, to another concept that has been central to the image of Western modernity: science. This article analyses comments about Islam gathered over the course of 117 interviews and 13 focus groups with non-Muslim members of the public and scientists in the UK and Canada on the theme of the relationship between science and religion. The article shows how participants’ accounts of Islam and science contrasted starkly with their accounts of other religious traditions, with a notable minority of predominantly non-religious interviewees describing Islam as uniquely, and uniformly, hostile to science and rational thought. It highlights how such descriptions of Islam were used to justify the cultural othering of Muslims in the West and anxieties about educational segregation, demographic ‘colonization’ and Islamist extremism. Using these data, the article argues for: (1) wider recognition of how popular understandings of science remain bound up with conceptions of Western cultural superiority; and (2) greater attentiveness to how prejudices concerning Islamic beliefs help make respectable the idea that Muslims pose a threat to the West.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Stephen H."},{"family":"Catto","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Kaden","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"}],"citation-key":"jonesThatsHowMuslims2019","container-title":"The Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0038026118778174","ISSN":"0038-0261","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"161-177","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘That’s how Muslims are required to view the world’: Race, culture and belief in non-Muslims’ descriptions of Islam and science","title-short":"‘That’s how Muslims are required to view the world’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026118778174","volume":"67"},

As such, they suggest religion is most strongly associated with the group-focused “binding” moral foundations of ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Two studies tested this hypothesis, investigating the role of political orientation in these relationships. These studies supported our hypothesis that general religiosity is positively associated with each of the group-focused moral foundations, even when controlling for the role of political orientation. Further, we find religious and political orientations interact such that low-religious political liberals are least likely to endorse group-focused moral intuitions.

The burgeoning research in this area creates a demand for a country-level religiosity index that is comparable across a large number of countries. Here, we offer such an index, which covers 166 countries and rests on representative data from 1,619,300 participants of the Gallup World Poll. Moreover, we validate the novel index, use it to examine temporal change in worldwide religiosity over the last decade, and present a comprehensive analysis of country-level religiosity’s nomological network. The main results are as follows. First, the index was found to be a valid index of global religiosity. Second, country-level religiosity modestly increased between 2006 and 2011 and modestly decreased between 2011 and 2017—demonstrating a curvilinear pattern. Finally, nomological network analysis revealed three things: it buttressed past evidence that religious countries are economically less developed; it clarified inconsistencies in the literature on the health status of inhabitants from religious countries, suggesting that their psychological and physical health tends to be particularly good once economic development is accounted for; and finally, it shed initial light on the associations between country-level religiosity and various psychological dimensions of culture (i.e., Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and country-level Big Five traits). These associations revealed that religious countries are primarily characterized by high levels of communion (i.e., collectivism and agreeableness). We are optimistic that the newly presented country-level religiosity index can satisfy the fast-growing demand for an accurate and comprehensive global religiosity index.

  {"id":"joshuaconradjacksonWhenGoodGod2019","abstract":"When might religious belief lower ethical standards? We propose a theory of religion and immorality that makes 3 central predictions. First, people will judge immoral acts as more permissible when they make divine attributions for these acts, seeing them as enabled by an intervening God. Second, people will be more likely to make divine attributions when evaluating passive immorality (e.g., keeping a lost wallet) than active immorality (e.g., pick-pocketing) because human action makes people less likely to infer God’s agency. Third, believers will be more likely than nonbelievers to perpetrate passive immorality, because they feel justified taking advantage of God’s beneficence. Thirteen studies support these predictions. Our findings show that people who attribute events to God judge morally questionable behaviors more leniently (Study 1), American states with more prayer groups have higher rates of crime (Study 2), and experimentally manipulated divine attributions lead people to see selfish and harmful behavior as less immoral (Study 3). Divine attributions—and corresponding moral permissibility—are more likely with passive immorality than with active immorality (Studies 4–7). Compared with nonbelievers, believers are more likely to justify their own passive immorality (Study 8), and to commit everyday acts of passive immorality such as parking across multiple spaces (Study 9) and keeping overdue library books (Study 10). A novel behavioral economics task reveals that although passive immorality is not affected by religious priming, it does correlate with self-reported religious belief (Studies 11–13). Finally, an internal meta-analysis supports our predictions.

It is argued that the notion of system-justification is necessary to account for previously unexplained phenomena, most notably the participation by disadvantaged individuals and groups in negative stereotypes of themselves, and the consensual nature of stereotypic beliefs despite differences in social relations within and between social groups. We offer a selective review of existing research that demonstrates the role of stereotypes in the production of false consciousness and develop the implications of a system-justification approach.

The results of the study suggest reason to doubt two common surmises about how these dynamics interact. First, the study presents both observational and experimental data inconsistent with the hypothesis that political conservatism is distinctively associated with closed-mindedness: conservatives did no better or worse than liberals on an objective measure of cognitive reflection; and more importantly, both demonstrated the same unconscious tendency to fit assessments of empirical evidence to their ideological predispositions. Second, the study suggests that this form of bias is not a consequence of overreliance on heuristic or intuitive forms of reasoning; on the contrary, subjects who scored highest in cognitive reflection were the most likely to display ideologically motivated cognition. These findings corroborated the hypotheses of a third theory, which identifies motivated cognition as a form of information processing that rationally promotes individuals’ interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important affinity groups.

We sought to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relations between religiosity, conservatism, and the moral foundations identified in MFT. Participants were 450 Christians who completed an online survey assessing outreaching faith, religious commitment, belief in an authoritarian God, Biblical literalism, and the prioritization of each of the five moral foundations. Conservatism and religious commitment were significant positive predictors of Loyalty. Controlling for conservatism and religious commitment, we found that Fairness was predicted by outreaching faith; Care was positively predicted by outreaching faith and negatively predicted by belief in an authoritarian God; Authority was predicted by literalism; and Purity was predicted by literalism and authoritarian God representations.

Adults have a strong sense of how knowledge is clustered in the world around them and use that sense to access additional information, defer to relevant experts, and ground their own incomplete understandings. One prominent way of clustering knowledge is by disciplines similar to those that comprise the natural and social sciences. Seven studies explored an emerging sense of these discipline-based ways of clustering of knowledge. Even 5-year-olds could cluster knowledge in a manner roughly corresponding to the departments of natural and social sciences in a university, doing so without any explicit awareness of those academic disciplines. But this awareness is fragile early on and competes with other ways of clustering knowledge. Over the next few years, children come to see discipline-based clusters as having a privileged status, one that may be linked to increasingly sophisticated assumptions about essences for natural kinds.

Laypeople’s explanatory understandings are remarkably coarse, full of gaps, and often full of inconsistencies. Even worse, most people overestimate their own understandings. Yet recent views suggest that formal scientists may not be so different. In spite of these limitations, science somehow works and its success offers hope for the feasibility of folk science as well. The success of science arises from the ways in which scientists learn to leverage understandings in other minds and to outsource explanatory work through sophisticated methods of deference and simplification of complex systems.

However, they can also impede formal science learning and provide the basis for robust scientific misconceptions. Addressing such misconceptions has generally been viewed as the province of secondary schooling. However, in this article, I argue that for a set of foundational but highly counterintuitive ideas (e.g., evolution by natural selection), coherent causal-explanatory instruction—instruction that emphasizes the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning natural phenomena—should be initiated much sooner, in early elementary school. This proposal is motivated by various findings from research in the cognitive, developmental, and learning sciences. For example, it has been shown that explanatory biases that render students susceptible to intuitively based scientific misconceptions emerge early in development. Furthermore, findings also reveal that once developed, such misconceptions are not revised and replaced by subsequently learned scientific theories but competitively coexist alongside them. Taken together, this research, along with studies revealing the viability of early coherent explanation-based instruction on counterintuitive theories, have significant implications for the timing, structure, and scope of early science education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelemen","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"kelemenMagicMechanismExplanationBased2019","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691619827011","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"510-522","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Magic of Mechanism: Explanation-Based Instruction on Counterintuitive Concepts in Early Childhood","title-short":"The Magic of Mechanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691619827011","volume":"14"},

Across three studies (combined N = 9,022) we expand on this line of inquiry to show for the first time that the ideological attitudes relating to authoritarianism and group-based dominance predict disagreement with the scientific consensus in several scientific domains. We show these effects are almost entirely mediated by varying combinations of ideological (political ideology, religiosity, free-market endorsement, conspiracy thinking) and science-specific (scientific knowledge, trust in scientists) constructs, depending on the scientific issue in question. Importantly, a general distrust of science and scientists emerges as the most consistent mediator across different scientific domains. We find that, consistent with previous research, the ideological roots of rejection of science vary across scientific issues. However, we also show that these roots may share a common origin in ideological attitudes regarding authority and equality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kerr","given":"John R."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Marc S."}],"citation-key":"kerrRightwingAuthoritarianismSocial2021","container-title":"Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","DOI":"10.1177/1368430221992126","ISSN":"1368-4302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"550-567","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation predict rejection of science and scientists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430221992126","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"keshetTookTroubleMake2021","abstract":"Voluminous scholarship has shown that religious leaders play an important role in helping patients cope with health issues. There is, however, little research on the impact of religious leaders on parents' decision-making processes pertaining to childhood vaccination. Ultra-orthodox Jewish religious leaders (rabbis) are considered authorities on health issues, and most of them encourage parents to vaccinate their children. Yet, there have been several recent outbreaks of measles in the ultra-orthodox population in Israel, as well as in other countries. The aim is to study the role played by rabbis in the decision-making process of Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish parents with regard to vaccination. In-depth interviews were conducted during 2019 with ten Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish mothers who do not vaccinate their children. The interviewees acknowledged that rabbis generally advocate vaccination. Yet they do not consult them and at times even disregard their instructions. The interviewees search for information on vaccination for themselves (mostly online) and decide not to vaccinate their children based on their assessment of risk. Contrary to the scholarly literature that points to the central role of religious leaders in dealing with health issues, the ultra-orthodox mothers' decision not to vaccinate their children appears to have been made despite the rabbis' instructions and not for religious reasons. These mothers' decision-making process is similar to that of mothers who do not vaccinate their children in other countries with respect to the aspect of gender, the search for information, and the reasons reported. Contacting the ultra-orthodox mothers directly and addressing their concerns about risk increase vaccination rates among the ultra-orthodox Jewish population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Keshet","given":"Yael"},{"family":"Popper-Giveon","given":"Ariela"}],"citation-key":"keshetTookTroubleMake2021","container-title":"Journal of Religion and Health","container-title-short":"J Relig Health","DOI":"10.1007/s10943-020-01122-4","ISSN":"1573-6571","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1992-2006","source":"Springer Link","title":"“I Took the Trouble to Make Inquiries, So I Refuse to Accept Your Instructions”: Religious Authority and Vaccine Hesitancy Among Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Mothers in Israel","title-short":"“I Took the Trouble to Make Inquiries, So I Refuse to Accept Your Instructions”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01122-4","volume":"60"},

That attention was renewed in 1997 following Dr Mahathir's recent denunciations of international currency speculation, as personified by George Soros. Yet at the same time that Dr Mahathir and his followers express their adverse views concerning Jews, there has also been evident in contemporary Malaysia, especially among the Malay political elite surrounding Dr Mahathir, a paradoxical fascination with the idea of 'diaspora', a desire to discover and even invent or create a 'Malay diaspora'. Understanding this peculiar 'diaspora-envy' may provide some insight into the modern Malay aspirations towards cosmopolitanism and 'global reach' that Dr Mahathir, with widespread domestic support, projects internationally. This 'diaspora-envy' seems the obverse side of Dr Mahathir's more direct and controversial views concerning Jews, and may throw some fresh light on them. Instead of providing evidence of classical political antisemitism, the views of Dr Mahathir and other leading Malaysians about Jews are the by-product of their views about other issues, especially the residue of a generally traditional religious education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kessler","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"kesslerMalayDiasporaAnother1999","container-title":"Patterns of Prejudice","DOI":"10.1080/003132299128810470","ISSN":"0031-322X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",1,1]]},"page":"23-42","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A Malay Diaspora?

Drawing on data from participant observation, in-depth interviews (N = 80) and nationally representative surveys (N = 1,763) with physicists and biologists in India, we begin to address this gap. We find that even though the majority of scientists report the independence view through our survey, when interviewed they say that religion and scientific work overlap considerably and in distinctive ways from the United States and the United Kingdom. Specifically, Indian scientific institutions (1) seek religious authorization, (2) offer religious accommodation to staff and students, and (3) facilitate selective integration of religion into the workplace. Our article shows how, in spite of scientists’ espoused preferences for non-overlapping magisteria and attempts to construct boundaries between religion and science, religion overlaps with science in scientific workplaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Khalsa","given":"Simranjit"},{"family":"Kalinowski","given":"Brenton"},{"family":"Vaidyanathan","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Ecklund","given":"Elaine Howard"}],"citation-key":"khalsaScienceReligionBoundaries2021","container-title":"Zygon Journal of Religion and Science","DOI":"10.1111/zygo.12760","ISSN":"1467-9744","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Science–Religion Boundaries in Indian Scientific Workplaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/zygo.12760","volume":"n/a"},
  {"id":"kienhuesBeliefsAbilitiesEpistemic2011","abstract":"When people stumble across inconsistent or conflicting scientific information, for example, on the Internet, they have to find an adequate explanation for the inconsistency or conflict. We focus on two types of explanations people could consider: the lack of one’s ability to understand the information or to explain away the inconsistency, and the actually given inconsistency that is inherent to the topic, as the knowledge in itself is developing or uncertain. We assert that in the above-described scenario, cognitive flexibility manifests in finding a suitable and adapted explanation for the experienced inconsistencies and that such flexibility depends on people’s beliefs about abilities and on their epistemic beliefs: To be able to distinguish between these two possible explanations, people have to have a realistic view of their own competencies, that is, adequate beliefs about their abilities (statement 1), and they have to hold a realistic view of the boundaries of scientific knowledge, that is, adequate epistemic beliefs (statement 2). In this chapter, several studies are summarized that underline both the role of beliefs about one’s abilities and epistemic beliefs in processing scientific information. Several empirical studies we conducted are introduced, which investigated both kinds of beliefs with respect to processing conflicting versus consistent information. These exemplar studies show that searching for scientific information on the Internet is a suitable test bed to empirically investigate the ways if and how people refer to ability and epistemic explanations for (conflicting) knowledge claims (statement 3). As a result of the studies, we propose that an empirical investigation of the interplay between beliefs about abilities and epistemic beliefs can contribute to the ongoing debate on the conceptualization of epistemic beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kienhues","given":"Dorothe"},{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"kienhuesBeliefsAbilitiesEpistemic2011","container-title":"Links Between Beliefs and Cognitive Flexibility: Lessons Learned","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-1793-0_6","editor":[{"family":"Elen","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Elmar"},{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Clarebout","given":"Geraldine"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-007-1793-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"105-124","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Beliefs About Abilities and Epistemic Beliefs: Aspects of Cognitive Flexibility in Information-Rich Environments","title-short":"Beliefs About Abilities and Epistemic Beliefs","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1793-0_6"},
  {"id":"kienhuesChangingEpistemologicalBeliefs2008","abstract":"Background Previous research has shown that sophisticated epistemological beliefs exert a positive influence on students' learning strategies and learning outcomes. This gives a clear educational relevance to studies on the development of methods for promoting a change in epistemological beliefs and making them more sophisticated. Aims To investigate the potential for influencing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short instructional intervention. Sample On the basis of their performance on a preliminary survey of epistemological beliefs, 58 students at a German university (87.7% females) with a mean age of 21.86 years (SD = 2.88) were selected. Half of them had more naive beliefs and the other half had more sophisticated ones. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one whose epistemological beliefs were challenged through refutational epistemological instruction or another receiving non-challenging informational instruction. The treatment effect was assessed by comparing pre- and post-instructional scores on two instruments tapping different layers of epistemological beliefs (DEBQ and CAEB). Data were subjected to factor analyses and analyses of variance. Results According to the CAEB, the naive group receiving the refutational epistemological instruction changed towards a more sophisticated view, whereas the sophisticated students receiving the informational instruction changed towards an unintended, more naive standpoint. According to the DEBQ, all research groups except the naive refutational group revealed changes towards a more naive view. Conclusions This study indicates the possibility of changing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short-term intervention. However, it questions the stability and elaborateness of domain-specific epistemological beliefs, particularly when domain knowledge is shallow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kienhues","given":"Dorothe"},{"family":"Bromme","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Elmar"}],"citation-key":"kienhuesChangingEpistemologicalBeliefs2008","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1348/000709907X268589","ISSN":"2044-8279","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"545-565","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Changing epistemological beliefs: The unexpected impact of a short-term intervention","title-short":"Changing epistemological beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000709907X268589","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"kimPerceptionsNursesHuman2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In June 2016, the Republic of Korea included free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations for all 12-year-old girls in its national immunization program.\nPURPOSE: This study investigated perceptions of nurses on HPV vaccination and their intent to vaccinate preteens at the best ages.\nMETHODS: Recruited for the survey were 514 health teachers (181, 35.2%), public health nurses (168, 32.7%), and clinical nurses (165, 32.1%). Factor-analysis was conducted to validate the Vaccine-Hesitancy Scale for Korean nurses. Related variables associated with vaccine-acceptance were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's rho coefficients, due to lack of normalization.\nRESULTS: Factor-analysis results showed that two factors of positive acceptance (7 items) and negative acceptance (3 items) accounted for 67.46% of the total variance, and explained 47.4% and 20.1%, respectively. Nurses who positively accepted HPV vaccine differed significantly in agreement to vaccinate girls or boys. For the proper vaccination age, a significant difference emerged between answers for girls and vaccine-acceptance scores, whereas no difference emerged between answers for boys and the scores. The vaccinated status of respondents significantly related to higher HPV vaccine acceptance, although age, religion, marital status, education, and working duration did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed that vaccine-acceptance levels reflect nurses' attitudes and opinions about HPV vaccination for girls and boys.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Hae Won"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hyang Yuol"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seong Eun"},{"family":"Ahn","given":"Hye Young"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yeon Hee"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Young Jin"}],"citation-key":"kimPerceptionsNursesHuman2019","container-title":"PloS One","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0211475","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e0211475","PMCID":"PMC6364919","PMID":"30726267","source":"PubMed","title":"Perceptions of nurses on human papillomavirus vaccinations in the Republic of Korea","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"kimRapidTransmissionCoronavirus2021","abstract":"Rapid transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was observed in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect in South Korea. The index case was confirmed on February 18, 2020 in Daegu City, and within two weeks, 3081 connected cases were identified. Doubling times during these initial stages (i.e., February 18 – March 2) of the outbreak were less than 2 days. A stochastic model fitted to the time series of confirmed cases suggests that the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 8.5 [95% credible interval (CrI): 6.3, 10.9] among the church members, whereas (R0 = 1.9 [95% CrI: 0.4, 4.4]) in the rest of the population of Daegu City. The model also suggests that there were already 4 [95% CrI: 2, 11] undetected cases of COVID-19 on February 7 when the index case reportedly presented symptoms. The Shincheonji Church cluster is likely to be emblematic of other outbreak-prone populations where R0 of COVID-19 is higher. Understanding and subsequently limiting the risk of transmission in such high-risk places is key to effective control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jong-Hoon"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hyojung"},{"family":"Won","given":"Yong Sul"},{"family":"Son","given":"Woo-Sik"},{"family":"Im","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"kimRapidTransmissionCoronavirus2021","container-title":"Epidemics","container-title-short":"Epidemics","DOI":"10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100519","ISSN":"1755-4365","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"100519","PMCID":"PMC8559423","PMID":"34742106","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Rapid transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 within a religious sect in South Korea: A mathematical modeling study","title-short":"Rapid transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 within a religious sect in South Korea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559423/","volume":"37"},

A validation process with 39 NRSs examined the reliability (interrater agreement), validity (the degree of correlation between the overall assessments of RoBANS and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies [MINORS], obtained by plotting the overall risk of bias relative to effect size and funding source), face validity with eight experts, and completion time for the RoBANS approach.\nResults\nRoBANS contains six domains: the selection of participants, confounding variables, the measurement of exposure, the blinding of the outcome assessments, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The interrater agreement of the RoBANS tool except the measurement of exposure and selective outcome reporting domains ranged from fair to substantial. There was a moderate correlation between the overall risks of bias determined using RoBANS and MINORS. The observed differences in effect sizes and funding sources among the assessed studies were not correlated with the overall risk of bias in these studies. The mean time required to complete RoBANS was approximately 10min. The external experts who were interviewed evaluated RoBANS as a “fair” assessment tool.\nConclusions\nRoBANS shows moderate reliability, promising feasibility, and validity.

However, most research on this outcome has focused on the content of educational programs (what educators offer) rather than on how students experience intercultural learning. This qualitative inquiry from the Wabash National Study analyzed 207 intercultural experiences from 161 college students on 6 campuses to identify contexts, characteristics, and key features of how they experience intercultural learning. Using grounded theory approaches, we summarized student interviews over 2 years, conducted open and axial coding to identify themes, and evaluated the themes over time. Using this approach, we identified three major themes: (a) that intercultural learning occurred when students directly encountered others' experiences; (b) that feeling safe enough to explore cultural differences was a key dimension of intercultural learning; and (c) that students used a variety of approaches that led to intercultural learning (from simply listening or watching to exploring how one's personal identity related to intercultural understanding) and that these varied in degree of complexity and agency. Implications for practice are offered to help educators make decisions about how to promote intercultural effectiveness in collegiate settings.

I attempt to do this in this chapter. First, I clarify the task of traditional epistemology as understood by philosophers and point out how it is different from epistemology as understood by PE researchers: epistemology is not postmodernist; it has a normative goal, which is different from empirical research; subfields of epistemology are briefly mentioned and implications for PE research suggested. Second, I point out the existence of several conceptual pitfalls that should be avoided by individuals working in this area: epistemic versus epistemological, 1st person versus 3rd person perspectives, and an important ambiguity in the concept of cognition. Third, the concept of cognitive flexibility in relation to epistemology needs to be carefully discussed, especially in relation to the issue of domain specificity and domain generality. This is discussed in the context of an epistemology of pragmatism.

This U-shaped pattern with SCC was not present with beliefs associated about government (Study 2) or science (Study 3), even though they serve some of the same psychological functions as God-beliefs.

Our analysis explored how these language-specific Twitter communities framed NATO's role in the conflict.ResultsWe found that English-speaking tweeters were more likely to hold NATO responsible for finding a solution and least likely to blame NATO for the war compared to German and Russian speakers. We also observed that the Russian-speaking Twitter community exhibits a comparatively lower tendency to hold NATO accountable for the ongoing war as compared to their German-speaking counterparts, and they are also notably the least likely to expect NATO to bring an end to the war. Finally, English-speaking Twitter users who attribute blame to NATO for the ongoing war tend to adhere to a preconceived notion, rather than arriving at an interpretation based on the situation at hand. This is in contrast to the Russian-speaking community, where the opposite is true. German-speaking users fall somewhere in between these two perspectives.DiscussionOur research contributes to the literature by providing a novel integration of conceptual and methodological perspectives on the framing and stance-taking of social media users during wartime, addressing known research gaps in the comparative analysis of these discussions, i.e., adding “non-English” perspectives. It also highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic sensitivity when addressing responsibility in armed conflicts and the need to consider the diverse perspectives derived from divergent problem definitions and evaluative standards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kobilke","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Kulichkina","given":"Aytalina"},{"family":"Baghumyan","given":"Ani"},{"family":"Pipal","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"kobilkeBlamingItNATO2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Political Science","DOI":"10.3389/fpos.2023.1122439","ISSN":"2673-3145","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Blaming it on NATO?

In study 1, a prior belief strength × agreement interaction was found, indicating that the agreement effect was larger among scientists who held strong prior beliefs. In both studies, the agreement effect was larger for general, evaluative judgments (e.g., relevance, methodological quality, results clarity) than for more specific, analytical judgments (e.g., adequacy of randomization procedures). A Bayesian analysis indicates that the pattern of agreement effects found in these studies may be normatively defensible, although arguments against implementing a Bayesian approach to scientific judgment are also advanced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Koehler","given":"Jonathan J."}],"citation-key":"koehlerInfluencePriorBeliefs1993","container-title":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","container-title-short":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","DOI":"10.1006/obhd.1993.1044","ISSN":"0749-5978","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",10,1]]},"page":"28-55","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Influence of Prior Beliefs on Scientific Judgments of Evidence Quality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597883710447","volume":"56"},
  {"id":"koenigBeliefActionScale2015","abstract":"We describe here a new measure of religious commitment, the Belief into Action (BIAC) scale. This measure was designed to be a comprehensive and sensitive measure of religious involvement that could discriminate individuals across the religious spectrum, and avoid the problem of ceiling effects that have haunted the study of  highly-religious populations. Many scales assess religious beliefs, where assent to belief is often widespread, subjective, and a superficial assessment of religious commitment. While people may say they believe, what does that mean in terms of action? This 10-item scale seeks to convert simple belief into action, where action is assessed in terms of what individuals say is most important in their lives, how they spend their time, and where they put their financial resources. We summarize here the psychometric characteristics of the BIAC in two very different populations: stressed female caregivers in Southern California and North Carolina, and college students attending three universities in Mainland China. We conclude that the BIAC is a sensitive, reliable, and valid measure of religious commitment in these two samples, and encourage research in other population groups using this scale to determine its psychometric properties more generally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Harold G."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhizhong"},{"family":"Al Zaben","given":"Faten"},{"family":"Adi","given":"Ahmad"}],"citation-key":"koenigBeliefActionScale2015","container-title":"Religions","DOI":"10.3390/rel6031006","ISSN":"2077-1444","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"1006-1016","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Belief into Action Scale: A Comprehensive and Sensitive Measure of Religious Involvement","title-short":"Belief into Action Scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/6/3/1006","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"koenigDukeUniversityReligion2010","abstract":"There is need for a brief measure of religiosity that can be included in epidemiological surveys to examine relationships between religion and health outcomes. The Duke University Religion Index (DUREL) is a five-item measure of religious involvement, and was developed for use in large cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies. The instrument assesses the three major dimensions of religiosity that were identified during a consensus meeting sponsored by the National Institute on Aging. Those three dimensions are organizational religious activity, non-organizational religious activity, and intrinsic religiosity (or subjective religiosity). The DUREL measures each of these dimensions by a separate “subscale”, and correlations with health outcomes should be analyzed by subscale in separate models. The overall scale has high test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation = 0.91), high internal consistence (Cronbach’s alpha’s = 0.78–0.91), high convergent validity with other measures of religiosity (r’s = 0.71–0.86), and the factor structure of the DUREL has now been demonstrated and confirmed in separate samples by other independent investigative teams. The DUREL has been used in over 100 published studies conducted throughout the world and is available in 10 languages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Harold G."},{"family":"Büssing","given":"Arndt"}],"citation-key":"koenigDukeUniversityReligion2010","container-title":"Religions","DOI":"10.3390/rel1010078","ISSN":"2077-1444","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"78-85","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Duke University Religion Index (DUREL): A Five-Item Measure for Use in Epidemological Studies","title-short":"The Duke University Religion Index (DUREL)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/1/1/78","volume":"1"},

The need to follow a standard procedure when developing new scales and translating old scales into new languages is essential in order to ensure that researchers accurately measure what they are claiming to measure. Well-designed scales form the foundation for much of the quantitative research conducted today in the psychological, social, behavioral and physical health sciences. This is also true for studies that examine the relationship between religiosity and/or spirituality (R/S) and health. The relationship between R/S and health is a complex one, requiring the development of measures that comprehensively, sensitively, reliably, and accurately measure R/S. As with many other emerging areas in the health sciences, quantitative measurement using psychometrically sound scales and the translation of existing scales into other languages is essential for advancement of the field of religion and health.

  {"id":"koftaWhatBreedsConspiracy2020","abstract":"Belief in conspiracy theories about Jews is a prototypical example of how a naïve theory can serve as a universal explanation of “all the bad things happening in society.” Such a theory often arises in times of political unrest that tend to breed feelings of uncertainty in politics and a lack of control over politics. As both uncertainty (a sense-making deficit) and lack of control (an agency deficit) can relate to conspiracy-based antisemitism, this research examines which of the two processes plays a pivotal role in the belief in Jewish conspiracy. Specifically, we hypothesize that political uncontrollability, rather than political uncertainty, is a critical factor in triggering conspiracy theories about groups. In Study 1 (N ϭ 812) we found that lack of control, but not uncertainty, in the political domain predicted belief in Jewish conspiracy, and subsequently led to increased discriminatory attitudes toward Jews. The results of longitudinal Study 2 (N ϭ 476) revealed that only political uncontrollability led to an increase in conspiracy-related stereotypes of Jews. In Study 3 (N ϭ 172) we found that experimental induction of political uncontrollability increased belief in Jewish, German, and Russian conspiracy, whereas induction of political uncertainty did not. Finally, Study 4 (N ϭ 370) replicated this pattern in another cultural context with more general measures of uncontrollability and uncertainty. It was lack of personal control, rather than uncertainty, that increased belief in Jewish conspiracy—and indirectly predicted other conspiracy theories. Our findings consistently support the critical role of political uncontrollability, not uncertainty, in triggering a conspiracy theory of Jews.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kofta","given":"Mirosław"},{"family":"Soral","given":"Wiktor"},{"family":"Bilewicz","given":"Michał"}],"citation-key":"koftaWhatBreedsConspiracy2020","container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/pspa0000183","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,6]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What breeds conspiracy antisemitism?

  {"id":"konnemannRoleEpistemicInsight2018","abstract":"This paper presents findings from a quasi-experimental study evaluating future teachers’ attitudes and beliefs in response to a cross-curricular university course on evolution and creation bridging biological and Christian theological perspectives. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that a course providing learning opportunities for epistemic insight within this multidisciplinary arena might have effects on attitudes and beliefs relevant to the field. Hence, the main research question was the following: To what extent do student teachers’ attitudes and beliefs change by attending a cross-curricular course on evolution and creation intended to develop student teachers’ epistemic insight into the nature of science and into the relationship between science and theology? The answer from this quasi-experimental evaluation study (pre–post-design; test group n = 26, control group n = 24) is as follows: It depends upon the variable investigated! Pre–post-analysis using a repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the cross-curricular course integrating epistemic insight induced changes in creationist beliefs, in students’ perception of conflict, and in acceptance of evolution. In contrast, there was no effect on attitudes toward evolutionary theory, on attitudes toward the Biblical accounts of creation, or on scientistic beliefs. However, when student responses were analyzed individually, case-based evidence for belief change in students with scientistic positions emerged. Among the reasons for those different effects, we discuss conceptual differences between attitude and acceptance, features of the student teacher sample, and the particular content of the course explicitly addressing creationism but not scientism. In conclusion, the paper corroborates the role of epistemic insight in the multidisciplinary field of evolution and creation and provides initial evidence that epistemic insight possesses a particular potential concerning positions at both ends of the spectrum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Konnemann","given":"Christiane"},{"family":"Höger","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Asshoff","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Hammann","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Rieß","given":"Werner"}],"citation-key":"konnemannRoleEpistemicInsight2018","container-title":"Research in Science Education","container-title-short":"Res Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11165-018-9783-y","ISSN":"1573-1898","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1187-1204","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Role for Epistemic Insight in Attitude and Belief Change?

  {"id":"kornVaccinationSocialContract2020","abstract":"Most vaccines protect both the vaccinated individual and the society by reducing the transmission of infectious diseases. In order to eliminate infectious diseases, individuals need to consider social welfare beyond mere self-interest—regardless of ethnic, religious, or national group borders. It has therefore been proposed that vaccination poses a social contract in which individuals are morally obliged to get vaccinated. However, little is known about whether individuals indeed act upon this social contract. If so, vaccinated individuals should reciprocate by being more generous to a vaccinated other. On the contrary, if the other doesn’t vaccinate and violates the social contract, generosity should decline. Three preregistered experiments investigated how a person’s own vaccination behavior, others’ vaccination behavior, and others’ group membership influenced a person’s generosity toward respective others. The experiments consistently showed that especially compliant (i.e., vaccinated) individuals showed less generosity toward nonvaccinated individuals. This effect was independent of the others’ group membership, suggesting an unconditional moral principle. An internal metaanalysis (n = 1,032) confirmed the overall social contract effect. In a fourth experiment (n = 1,212), this pattern was especially pronounced among vaccinated individuals who perceived vaccination as a moral obligation. It is concluded that vaccination is a social contract in which cooperation is the morally right choice. Individuals act upon the social contract, and more so the stronger they perceive it as a moral obligation. Emphasizing the social contract could be a promising intervention to increase vaccine uptake, prevent free riding, and, eventually, support the elimination of infectious diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Korn","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Böhm","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Nicolas W."},{"family":"Betsch","given":"Cornelia"}],"citation-key":"kornVaccinationSocialContract2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1919666117","ISBN":"9781919666112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,30]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

Moreover, we claim that people who dogmatically do not believe in religion and those who dogmatically believe in religion are equally prone to intolerance and prejudice towards groups that violate their important values. That is because prejudice towards these groups may be an efficient strategy to protect the certainty that strong beliefs provide. We tested these assumptions in two studies. In Study 1 and Study 2, we demonstrated that dogmatic beliefs mediate the relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and both, religious orthodoxy and dogmatic atheism. In addition, in Study 2 we showed that both the religiously orthodox and dogmatic atheists become prejudiced towards groups that violate their values and that these effects are especially strong under experimentally induced uncertainty. In this study, we focused on atheists and homosexuals as groups that pose a threat to Christian's religious worldviews, and Catholics and pro-life supporters as groups that pose a threat to the values of atheists.

This article proposes that this is the case only when religiosity reﬂects a speciﬁc aspect of seeking guidance and security in daily practices and complex sociocultural norms. Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that belief in God provides are rejected in an effort to protect this certainty. The results from two studies found that uncertainty avoidance was related to belief in God and this belief mediated the relationship between uncertainty avoidance and intolerance within the context of general human rights (Study 1), and the derogation of value-violating groups (e.g., homosexuals or followers of other religions) but not of groups that pose no threat to religious values (old or poor people) (Study 2). The interpretative dimension of religiosity (i.e., the way in which people process religious content) is not connected to security seeking, as reﬂected in the lack of a correlation with uncertainty avoidance and with different prejudice measures. The results are discussed in relation to past research on religiosity and prejudice, and suggest that for people who avoid uncertainty, only those types of religious beliefs that provide a sense of certainty are linked with intolerance toward value-violating groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kossowska","given":"Małgorzata"},{"family":"Sekerdej","given":"Maciej"}],"citation-key":"kossowskaSearchingCertaintyReligious2015","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2015.03.053","ISSN":"01918869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"language":"en","page":"72-76","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Searching for certainty: Religious beliefs and intolerance toward value-violating groups","title-short":"Searching for certainty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019188691500238X","volume":"83"},

To illustrate the negative implications of morality, we detail two specific examples of how moral convictions impair societal progress: the rejection of science and technology, and political polarization in the United States. Specifically, we discuss how moral convictions can cause individuals to challenge scientific facts (e.g., evolution), oppose technologies that can improve health and well-being (e.g., vaccinations and GMO foods), and fuel political polarization and segregation.

The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context—and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike.

  {"id":"krepsHypocriticalFlipflopCourageous2017","abstract":"How do audiences react to leaders who change their opinion after taking moral stances? We propose that people believe moral stances are stronger commitments, compared with pragmatic stances; we therefore explore whether and when audiences believe those commitments can be broken. We find that audiences believe moral commitments should not be broken, and thus that they deride as hypocritical leaders who claim a moral commitment and later change their views. Moreover, they view them as less effective and less worthy of support. Although participants found a moral mind changer especially hypocritical when they disagreed with the new view, the effect persisted even among participants who fully endorsed the new view. We draw these conclusions from analyses and meta-analyses of 15 studies (total N = 5,552), using recent statistical advances to verify the robustness of our findings. In several of our studies, we also test for various possible moderators of these effects; overall we find only 1 promising finding: some evidence that 2 specific justifications for moral mind changes—citing a personally transformative experience, or blaming external circumstances rather than acknowledging opinion change—help moral leaders appear more courageous, but no less hypocritical. Together, our findings demonstrate a lay belief that moral views should be stable over time; they also suggest a downside for leaders in using moral framings.

  {"id":"krok-schoenBeliefMandatorySchool2018","abstract":"Purpose To examine how demographic, general health, religious, and political characteristics influenced beliefs about mandatory school vaccinations and history of vaccination refusal for children among Ohio Appalachian parents. Methods In 2013 and 2014, baseline data were obtained from parents (n = 337) of girls aged 9-17 from 12 counties in rural Ohio Appalachia enrolled in the Community Awareness, Resources and Education (CARE II) Project. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of parental beliefs about mandatory school vaccinations and history of refusing a doctor-recommended vaccine for their child(ren). Results About 47% of parents agreed that parents should have the right to refuse mandatory school vaccinations for their child(ren). Participants who reported their political affiliation as Republican (OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.28-4.66) or Independent (OR = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.70-6.44) were more likely to agree that parents should have the right to refuse school-mandated vaccinations than parents who reported their political affiliation as Democrat. Approximately 39% of parents reported ever refusing a vaccine for their child(ren). Participants who were female (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.04-14.58) and believed that parents should have the right to refuse mandatory school vaccinations (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.90-5.62) were more likely to report ever refusing a vaccine for their child(ren). Conclusion The study findings provide information to better understand factors related to vaccination refusal among parents in Appalachia Ohio that can be used to design interventions to improve vaccination uptake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Krok-Schoen","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Brittany M."},{"family":"Weier","given":"Rory C."},{"family":"Peng","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Katz","given":"Mira L."},{"family":"Reiter","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Morgan S."},{"family":"Pennell","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Tatum","given":"Cathy M."},{"family":"Paskett","given":"Electra D."}],"citation-key":"krok-schoenBeliefMandatorySchool2018","container-title":"The Journal of Rural Health","DOI":"10.1111/jrh.12285","ISSN":"1748-0361","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"283-292","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Belief About Mandatory School Vaccinations and Vaccination Refusal Among Ohio Appalachian Parents: Do Demographic and Religious Factors, General Health, and Political Affiliation Play a Role?","title-short":"Belief About Mandatory School Vaccinations and Vaccination Refusal Among Ohio Appalachian Parents","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jrh.12285","volume":"34"},

The multifinality construct denotes a motivational structure wherein a single means is linked to several ends. A multifinality configuration maximizes value that a given means promises to deliver while sacrificing expectancy of attainment due to a dilution effect. Several phenomena implied by multifinality theory are investigated, including an unconscious quest for multifinal means, the constraints that such quest imposes on means to a focal goal, and structural conditions under which an activity may be experienced as intrinsically motivated. Multifinality phenomena appear in numerous domains of social cognition, and the present theory offers a novel perspective on classic motivational effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."},{"family":"Köpetz","given":"Catalina"},{"family":"Bélanger","given":"Jocelyn J."},{"family":"Chun","given":"Woo Young"},{"family":"Orehek","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Fishbach","given":"Ayelet"}],"citation-key":"kruglanskiFeaturesMultifinality2013","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/1088868312453087","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-39","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Features of Multifinality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868312453087","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"kruglanskiHabitualBehaviorGoalDriven2020","abstract":"We address the relation between goal-driven and habitual behaviors. Whereas in recent years the two have been juxtaposed, we suggest that habitual behavior is in fact goal-driven. To support this view, we show that habitual behavior is sensitive to changes in goal properties (reward contingencies), namely goal value and its expectancy of attainment. Whereas adjustment to these properties may be slower for habitual (or overlearned) than for nonhabitual behavior, this is likely due to the routinized (or automatic) nature of such behavior, characterized as it is by reduced attention to its consequences. Furthermore, we show that habitual behavior’s prolonged persistence despite its manifest detachment from the original goal likely stems from its attachment to a different goal. Thus, there is no need to postulate purposeless behavior. The view that habitual behavior is goal-driven offers an integrative account of a considerable body of evidence and is consistent with a functional account of psychological processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."},{"family":"Szumowska","given":"Ewa"}],"citation-key":"kruglanskiHabitualBehaviorGoalDriven2020","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691620917676","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1256-1271","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Habitual Behavior Is Goal-Driven","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620917676","volume":"15"},

In Studies 3 and 4, the number of means to participants' goals was experimentally manipulated. All four studies found that means commitment is negatively related, whereas goal commitment is positively related, to means number. Consistent support was also obtained for the notion that the relation between means number and goal commitment is mediated by the expectancy of goal attainment, and by goal importance.

Accordingly, we conceptualize intrinsic motivation (IM) as (perceived) means-ends fusion and define an intrinsicality continuum reflecting the degree to which such fusion is experienced. Our means-ends fusion (MEF) theory assumes four major antecedents of activity-goal fusion: (a) repeated pairing of the activity and the goal, (b) uniqueness of the activity-goal connection, (c) perceived similarity between the activity and its goal, and (d) temporal immediacy of goal attainment following the activity. MEF theory further identifies two major consequences of the activity-goal fusion (i.e., manifestations of intrinsic motivation): (a) perceived instrumentality of the activity to goal attainment and consequent activity engagement, and (b) goal-related affective experience of the activity. Empirical evidence for MEF theory comes from diverse fields of psychological inquiry, including animal learning, brain research, and social cognition.

So far, belief updating has been investigated in partly unrelated lines of research from different psychological disciplines. In this article, we aim to integrate these disparate lines of research. After presenting some prominent theoretical frameworks and experimental designs that have been used for the study of belief updating, we review how healthy people and people with mental disorders update their beliefs after receiving new information that supports or challenges their views. Available evidence suggests that both healthy people and people with particular mental disorders are prone to certain biases when updating their beliefs, although the nature of the respective biases varies considerably and depends on several factors. Anomalies in belief updating are discussed in terms of both new insights into the psychopathology of various mental disorders and societal implications, such as irreconcilable political and societal controversies due to the failure to take information into account that disconfirms one’s own view. We conclude by proposing a novel integrative model of belief updating and derive directions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kube","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Rozenkrantz","given":"Liron"}],"citation-key":"kubeWhenBeliefsFace2021","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691620931496","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"247-274","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"When Beliefs Face Reality: An Integrative Review of Belief Updating in Mental Health and Illness","title-short":"When Beliefs Face Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620931496","volume":"16"},

Initially, the objective dimension dominates, to the exclusion of subjectivity; subsequently, the subjective dimension assumes an ascendant position and the objective is abandoned, and, finally, the two are coordinated. This progression, we further postulate, tends to occur in a systematic order across different judgment domains (personal taste, aesthetic, value, and truth), with the orders the reverse of one another in the two major transitions that constitute this progression. These predictions are supported among a sample of seven groups of children, adolescents, and adults varying in age, education, and life experience. Subjectivity is most readily acknowledged in personal taste and aesthetic judgments and least readily in truth judgments. Once subjectivity is accepted and becomes dominant, objectivity is reintegrated in the reverse order, i.e., most readily with respect to truth judgments. Not predicted, however, was the finding that for a number of individuals, both transitions proved most difficult in the values domain. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Individual and developmental differences in what it means to know something, and hence in the criteria for justifying knowledge claims, have potentially wide-ranging implications. In providing support for a claim, young children have difficulty differentiating explanation of why a claim makes sense and evidence that the claim is true. Epistemic understanding progresses developmentally, but substantial variation remains among adults, with few adults achieving understanding of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of evidence and explanation in argument. Epistemic understanding shapes intellectual values and hence the disposition (as opposed to competence) to exercise intellectual skills. Only its most advanced levels support a disposition to engage in the intellectual effort that reasoned argument entails. The sample case of juror reasoning illustrates how epistemic understanding underlies and shapes intellectual performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Deanna"}],"citation-key":"kuhnHowPeopleKnow2001","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9280.00302","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How do People Know?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00302","volume":"12"},

Islam, as a major world religion which shares the same Abrahamic roots as the Judaeo-Christian tradition, has been largely absent from this debate. Most conservationists now believe that it is essential that there be comprehensive discussion not only of environmental policies, but also of the ethics underlying environmental protection. This paper looks at the importance of the environment in the main sources of Islamic instruction, namely the Koran and Prophet’s Hadiths (teachings). These texts turn out to be on the side of conservation, the emphasis being on respect for creation, the protection of the natural order and avoidance of all wasteful activities which may cause injury to the environment. These positions are contrasted with views expressed by political Islam, which has become inﬂuential in a large part of the Muslim world and rejects the conservation measures advocated by Western writers.","author":[{"family":"Kula","given":"E"}],"citation-key":"kulaIslamEnvironmentalConservation2001","container-title":"Environmental Conservation","DOI":"10.1017/S0376892901000017","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","source":"Zotero","title":"Islam and environmental conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/abs/islam-and-environmental-conservation/F3693050A2787447992CF816B5DCE84B","volume":"28"},

The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions.

  {"id":"laakasuoWhatMakesPeople2018","abstract":"The idea of separating a person’s consciousness and transferring it to another medium—'mind upload'—is being actively discussed in science, philosophy, and science fiction. Mind upload technologies are currently also being developed by private companies in Silicon Valley, and similar technological developments have received significant funding in the EU. Mind upload has important existential and ethical implications, yet little is known about how ordinary people actually feel about it. The current paper aims to provide a thorough moral psychological evaluation about various cognitive factors that explain people’s feelings and reactions towards the use of mind upload technology. In four studies (including pilot) with a total of 952 participants, it was shown that biological and cultural cognitive factors help to determine how strongly people condemn mind upload. Both experimental manipulations in a laboratory and cross-sectional correlative online study designs were employed. The results showed that people who value purity norms and have higher sexual disgust sensitivity are more inclined to condemn mind upload. Furthermore, people who are anxious about death and condemn suicidal acts were more accepting of mind upload. Finally, higher science fiction literacy and/or hobbyism strongly predicted approval of mind upload. Several possible confounding factors were ruled out, including personality, values, individual tendencies towards rationality, and theory of mind capacities. Possible idiosyncrasies in the stimulus materials (whether consciousness is uploaded onto a computer, chimpanzee, artificial brain, or android; and whether the person’s body physically dies during the process) were ruled out. The core findings inform ongoing philosophical discussions on how mind upload could (or should) be used in the future, and imply that mind upload is a much more salient topic for the general population than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Laakasuo","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Drosinou","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Koverola","given":"Mika"},{"family":"Kunnari","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Halonen","given":"Juho"},{"family":"Lehtonen","given":"Noora"},{"family":"Palomäki","given":"Jussi"}],"citation-key":"laakasuoWhatMakesPeople2018","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","container-title-short":"Palgrave Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-018-0124-6","ISSN":"2055-1045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-14","publisher":"Palgrave","source":"www-nature-com.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de","title":"What makes people approve or condemn mind upload technology?

  {"id":"lakensValuePreregistrationPsychological2019","abstract":"For over two centuries researchers have been criticized for using research practices that makes it easier to present data in line with what they wish to be true. With the rise of the internet it has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials, and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo, 2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to test predictions with severity should find value in the practice of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lakens","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"lakensValuePreregistrationPsychological2019","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/jbh4w","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,18]]},"language":"en","publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Value of Preregistration for Psychological Science: A Conceptual Analysis","title-short":"The Value of Preregistration for Psychological Science","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/jbh4w"},

  {"id":"laneVaccineHesitancyGlobe2018","abstract":"In order to gather a global picture of vaccine hesitancy and whether/how it is changing, an analysis was undertaken to review three years of data available as of June 2017 from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Report Form (JRF) to determine the reported rate of vaccine hesitancy across the globe, the cited reasons for hesitancy, if these varied by country income level and/or by WHO region and whether these reasons were based upon an assessment. The reported reasons were classified using the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization matrix of hesitancy determinants (www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/october/SAGE_working_group_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf). Hesitancy was common, reported by >90% of countries. The list of cited reasons was long and covered 22 of 23 WHO determinants matrix categories. Even the most frequently cited category, risk- benefit (scientific evidence e.g. vaccine safety concerns), accounted for less than one quarter of all reasons cited. The reasons varied by country income level, by WHO region and over time and within a country. Thus based upon this JRF data, across the globe countries appear to understand the SAGE vaccine hesitancy definition and use it to report reasons for hesitancy. However, the rigour of the cited reasons could be improved as only just over 1/3 of countries reported that their reasons were assessment based, the rest were opinion based. With respect to any assessment in the previous five years, upper middle income countries were the least likely to have done an assessment. These analyses provided some of the evidence for the 2017 Assessment Report of the Global Vaccine Action Plan recommendation that each country develop a strategy to increase acceptance and demand for vaccination, which should include ongoing community engagement and trust-building, active hesitancy prevention, regular national assessment of vaccine concerns, and crisis response planning (www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/1_GVAP_Assessment_report_web_version.pdf).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Lane","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"Noni E."},{"family":"Marti","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Dumolard","given":"Laure"}],"citation-key":"laneVaccineHesitancyGlobe2018","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.063","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3861-3867","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Vaccine hesitancy around the globe: Analysis of three years of WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form data-2015–2017","title-short":"Vaccine hesitancy around the globe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18304195","volume":"36"},

The definition of vaccine hesitancy and a matrix of determinants guided the development of a survey tool to assess the nature and scale of hesitancy issues. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy questions were piloted in the annual WHO-UNICEF joint reporting form, completed by National Immunization Managers globally. The objective of characterizing the nature and scale of vaccine hesitancy issues is to better inform the development of appropriate strategies and policies to address the concerns expressed, and to sustain confidence in vaccination. The Working Group developed a matrix of the determinants of vaccine hesitancy informed by a systematic review of peer reviewed and grey literature, and by the expertise of the working group. The matrix mapped the key factors influencing the decision to accept, delay or reject some or all vaccines under three categories: contextual, individual and group, and vaccine-specific.

It recognizes a continuum between the domains of vaccine acceptance and vaccine refusal and de-polarizes previous characterization of individuals and groups as either anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine. The primary aims of this systematic review are to: 1) identify research on vaccine hesitancy; 2) identify determinants of vaccine hesitancy in different settings including its context-specific causes, its expression and its impact; and 3) inform the development of a model for assessing determinants of vaccine hesitancy in different settings as proposed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group (SAGE WG) for dealing with vaccine hesitancy. A broad search strategy, built to capture multiple dimensions of public trust, confidence and hesitancy around vaccines, was applied across multiple databases. Peer-reviewed studies were selected for inclusion if they focused on childhood vaccines [≤7 years of age], used multivariate analyses, and were published between January 2007 and November 2012. Our results show a variety of factors as being associated with vaccine hesitancy but they do not allow for a complete classification and confirmation of their independent and relative strength of influence.

  {"id":"lascauxKidsUnicornsHow2020","abstract":"When young children confront a vast array of adults' testimonial claims, they should decide which testimony to endorse. If they are unable to immediately verify the content of testimonial assertions, children adopt or reject their informants' statements on the basis of forming trust in the sources of testimony. This kind of trust needs to be based on some underlying reasons. The rational choice theory, which currently dominates the social, cognitive, and psychological sciences, posits that trust should be formed on a rational basis, as a result of probabilistic assessments and utility-maximizing calculations. In this paper, the predictions stemming from the rational choice approach to trust are systematically compared with the empirical evidence from the field of developmental psychology on how children establish their trust in testimonial statements. The results of this comparison demonstrate an obvious inadequacy of the rational choice explanation of the emergence and development of children's testimonial trust, regardless of which form of trust rationality—weighting, threshold, or ordering—is examined. As none of the three forms of rationality of children's trust in testimony squares with the empirical data, this paper introduces a new version of trust rationality, adaptively rational trust. It explores the compatibility of the concept of adaptively rational trust with the recent empirical findings in the area of developmental psychology and addresses some avenues for future research on the rationality of testimonial trust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lascaux","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"lascauxKidsUnicornsHow2020","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/cogs.12819","ISSN":"1551-6709","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2020 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","page":"e12819","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Of Kids and Unicorns: How Rational Is Children's Trust in Testimonial Knowledge?","title-short":"Of Kids and Unicorns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cogs.12819","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"lauExploringTrustReligious2020","abstract":"Objectives In the context of persistent child malnutrition in the Philippines, the objective of this study was to examine how different dimensions of trust affected programme retention and physiological outcomes when a faith-based organisation (FBO) addressed moderate and severe acute malnutrition among children from households experiencing extreme poverty.\nSetting We retrospectively analysed survey data collected by International Care Ministries (ICM) in 2012–2013 across 150 communities in eight provinces (Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, Bohol, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Zamboanga del Norte) of the Philippines.\nStudy participants Caregivers of 1192 children experiencing moderate acute malnutrition and severe acute malnutrition between the ages of 6 and 60 months.\nIntervention A 16-week child malnutrition treatment programme called Malnourished Child Outreach offered by ICM in partnership with local religious leaders and institutions.\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures Programme dropout and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) at the end of the programme for enrolled children were the two outcomes of interest. A logistic mixed-effects model was built to assess factors associated with programme dropout and a linear mixed-effects model for factors associated with WHZ at the end of the programme.\nResults Trust in religious leaders or institutions (−0.87 (95% CI: −1.43,–0.26)) was negatively associated with programme dropout, suggesting that with increasing levels of trust, decreasing proportions of children dropped out of treatment. Retention in the programme led to improved WHZ among participating children (−0.38 (95% CI: −1.43, 0.26)). Various measures of social capital, including trust in religious and public institutions, were not associated with WHZ at the end of the programme.\nConclusions Leveraging pre-existing trust in religious leaders and institutions among households experiencing extreme poverty is one way that ICM, and potentially other FBOs, can promote retention in child nutrition interventions among vulnerable populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Lau","given":"Lincoln Leehang"},{"family":"Dodd","given":"Warren"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Han Lily"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Donald C."}],"citation-key":"lauExploringTrustReligious2020","container-title":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036091","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Interest and emotional factors are further differentiated into situation-related and habitual (most likely biographically determined) components. In constructing the teaching unit (basic electricity) a learning oriented knowledge acquisition phase was followed by a more achievement oriented practice phase. Analysis shows that positive emotions are more important in the acquisition phase than in the practice phase. Anxieties play an ambiguous role in the practice phase. Additionally, the results provide indications that joy about learning in particular, and also interest are frequently linked to successful learning processes, and not merely to the nature of the subject matter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Laukenmann","given":"Matthius"},{"family":"Bleicher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fuß","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Gläser-Zikuda","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Mayring","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Rhöneck","given":"Christoph","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"laukenmannInvestigationInfluenceEmotional2003","container-title":"International Journal of Science Education","DOI":"10.1080/09500690210163233","ISSN":"0950-0693","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1,1]]},"page":"489-507","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"An investigation of the influence of emotional factors on learning in physics instruction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500690210163233","volume":"25"},

In Study 3, participants high in intellectual humility were less inclined to think that politicians who changed their attitudes were “flip-flopping,” and Study 4 showed that people high in intellectual humility were more attuned to the strength of persuasive arguments than those who were low.

Using data from 71 diverse societies in the World Values Survey (n = 120,728), this study assesses the relative predictive strength of science optimism, moral concerns about science, religiosity, and religious exclusivism. Perhaps counterintuitively, science beliefs (science optimism, in particular) are weak predictors of the outcome, even in wealthy societies with high levels of scientific productivity. In contrast, believing that only one’s religion is acceptable is the strongest predictor of choosing religion over science; this is generally consistent across religious groups, regions, and specific countries/territories. These findings suggest that making the public more aware of major scientific advances will not, by itself, increase the cultural authority of science—especially if it is explicitly contested by another influential social institution.

Converging developmental research from diverse cultural contexts in 3 areas of biological thought (i.e., the origin of species, illness, and death) is reviewed to support this claim.

The chapter first reviews research demonstrating that coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations is not a short-lived, transitional phenomenon that wanes in the course of development, but is instead evident (and widespread) among adults. It then speculates on the psychological origins of coexistence and discusses implications for metacognition.

Although cognitive developmental psychologists have studied the topic of explanation quite extensively, until recently little has been known about how people interpret, accommodate, and reconcile natural and supernatural explanations in everyday life. We review psychological data from three core biological domains and provide an analysis of how philosophical and psychological accounts are complementary. We propose that emerging psychological accounts of the coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations may be developed further by adopting the conceptual resources provided by philosophers, especially with respect to the topics of explanation and possible relationships between science and religion. Furthermore, psychological data can inform philosophical accounts by providing information concerning how people reason about topics of fundamental concern to humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Legare","given":"Cristine H."},{"family":"Visala","given":"Aku"}],"citation-key":"legareReligionScienceIntegrating2011","container-title":"Human Development","container-title-short":"HDE","DOI":"10.1159/000329135","ISSN":"0018-716X, 1423-0054","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"english","page":"169-184","publisher":"Karger Publishers","source":"www.karger.com","title":"Between Religion and Science: Integrating Psychological and Philosophical Accounts of Explanatory Coexistence","title-short":"Between Religion and Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/329135","volume":"54"},

We explore the extent to which perceptions of conflict or compatibility between science and religion are content dependent and are associated with participants’ own religious or non-religious social identities. In doing so, we develop a novel Science and Religion Conflict/Compatibility Scale. Across three studies (n = 1,506), we consistently find group differences between atheists, agnostics or other non-religious individuals, and religious individuals. Religious individuals reported the highest levels of compatibility and atheists the highest levels of conflict between science and religion. Additionally, perceptions of conflict between science and religion were divided into two distinct content areas. The first included items concerning big-picture explanations, such as understanding the origins of human life. The second content area formed around items that describe interactions between humans and the world, such as treating mental illness. We conclude that research examining perceptions of conflict between science and religion needs to adopt a more nuanced approach, that takes into account individuals’ identities and the context in which the relationship between science and religion is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Leicht","given":"Carola"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Carissa A."},{"family":"LaBouff","given":"Jordan P."},{"family":"Zarzeczna","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"}],"citation-key":"leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021","container-title":"The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion","DOI":"10.1080/10508619.2021.2003111","ISSN":"1050-8619","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,10]]},"page":"1-24","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Content Matters: Perceptions of the Science-Religion Relationship","title-short":"Content Matters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10508619.2021.2003111","volume":"0"},

Some individuals may be more open minded regarding certain explanations for events whereas others may seek closure and thus cut off a conspiracy explanation. Two studies examined the relationship between the need for cognitive closure (NFCC), levels of belief in real world conspiracy theories, and the attribution of conspiracy theories to explain events. A first, small (N = 30) and preliminary study found no relationship between NFCC and beliefs in conspiracy theories, suggesting that both advocates and opponents of conspiracy explanations do not differ on this dimension. A second study (N = 86) revealed that evidence for and against conspiracy theories had an influence on attributions of the likelihood of a conspiracy to explain a novel event. Specifically, after reading evidence individuals with high levels of belief in conspiracy theories tended to rate a conspiracy explanation as more likely whereas those with low levels of belief rated it as less likely. However, when the need for cognitive closure (NFCC) was experimentally lowered the effects of prior beliefs in conspiracy theories diminished.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"LEMAN","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Cinnirella","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"lemanBeliefsConspiracyTheories2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00378","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Beliefs in conspiracy theories and the need for cognitive closure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00378","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"lemosExploratoryConfirmatoryFactor2019","abstract":"We describe an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the International Social Survey Programme Religion Cumulation (1991-1998-2008) data set, to identify the factors of individual religiosity and their interrelations in quantitative terms. The exploratory factor analysis was performed using data from the first two waves (1991 and 1998), and led to the identification of four strongly correlated and reliable factors which we labeled “Religious formation,” “Supernatural beliefs,” “Belief in God,” and “Religious practice.” The confirmatory factor analysis was run using data from 2008, and led to the confirmation of this four-factor structure with very good fit measures. We also ran a set of structural equation models in an attempt to determine the causality links between these four factors. It was found that for the models which provide the best fit “Belief in God” does not cause “Supernatural beliefs”, “Religious practice” can cause “Belief in God” and that there are multiple paths leading to “Belief in God,” most of which include “Religious formation” as a source. The exploratory factor analysis also led to the identification of other factors related to traditional values, confidence in institutions and influence of religious leaders on politics, but these were found to have lower reliability or insufficient number of items to meet the acceptance criteria, and thus were not included in the confirmatory factor analysis and the investigation of causal links. The results obtained in this work have important material implications for the conceptualization of ”religiosity,” and important methodological implications for the scientific study of religion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemos","given":"Carlos Miguel"},{"family":"Gore","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Shults","given":"F.

Using a new methodology to map out how individuals conceive of the moral domain, we find dramatic differences among adherents of different religions.

He argues that they exhibit much more sensitivity to context than factual beliefs: outside of contexts in which they are salient, they do not govern behaviour or inference, or provide background assumptions for cognition. This article surveys a large range of data to show that the kind of context sensitivity that Van Leeuwen thinks is the province of religious beliefs does not correlate with belief content. Beliefs about matters of fact beyond the theological realm exhibit this kind of sensitivity too. Conversely, theological and supernatural beliefs often guide behaviour across contexts. It is the intuitiveness of representations across contexts that predicts context (in)sensitivity, and intuitiveness is powerfully influenced by processing fluency. Fluency, in turn, is sensitive to cues that vary across contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"levyReligiousBeliefsAre2017","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.012","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109-116","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Religious beliefs are factual beliefs: Content does not correlate with context sensitivity","title-short":"Religious beliefs are factual beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300203","volume":"161"},

We summarize how people respond to corrections of misinformation, and what kinds of corrections are most eﬀective. We argue that to be eﬀective, scientiﬁc research into misinformation must be considered within a larger political, technological, and societal context. The post-truth world emerged as a result of societal mega-trends such as a decline in social capital, growing economic inequality, increased polarization, declining trust in science, and an increasingly fractionated media landscape. We suggest that responses to this malaise must involve technological solutions incorporating psychological principles, an interdisciplinary approach that we describe as “technocognition”.

Internet blogs in particular have become the staging ground for conspiracy theories that challenge the link between HIV and AIDS, the benefits of vaccinations, or the reality of climate change. A recent study involving visitors to climate blogs found that conspiracist ideation was associated with the rejection of climate science and other scientific propositions such as the link between lung cancer and smoking, and between HIV and AIDS. That article stimulated considerable discursive activity in the climate blogosphere—i.e., the numerous blogs dedicated to climate “skepticism”—that was critical of the study. The blogosphere discourse was ideally suited for analysis because its focus was clearly circumscribed, it had a well-defined onset, and it largely discontinued after several months. We identify and classify the hypotheses that questioned the validity of the paper’s conclusions using well-established criteria for conspiracist ideation. In two behavioral studies involving naive participants we show that those criteria and classifications were reconstructed in a blind test.

  {"id":"lewandowskyRoleConspiracistIdeation2013","abstract":"Background: Among American Conservatives, but not Liberals, trust in science has been declining since the 1970’s. Climate science has become particularly polarized, with Conservatives being more likely than Liberals to reject the notion that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the globe. Conversely, opposition to genetically-modified (GM) foods and vaccinations is often ascribed to the political Left although reliable data are lacking. There are also growing indications that rejection of science is suffused by conspiracist ideation, that is the general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories including the specific beliefs that inconvenient scientific findings constitute a ‘‘hoax.’’\nMethodology/Principal findings: We conducted a propensity weighted internet-panel survey of the U.S. population and show that conservatism and free-market worldview strongly predict rejection of climate science, in contrast to their weaker and opposing effects on acceptance of vaccinations. The two worldview variables do not predict opposition to GM. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, predicts rejection of all three scientific propositions, albeit to greatly varying extents. Greater endorsement of a diverse set of conspiracy theories predicts opposition to GM foods, vaccinations, and climate science.\nConclusions: Free-market worldviews are an important predictor of the rejection of scientific findings that have potential regulatory implications, such as climate science, but not necessarily of other scientific issues. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, is associated with the rejection of all scientific propositions tested. We highlight the manifold cognitive reasons why conspiracist ideation would stand in opposition to the scientific method. The involvement of conspiracist ideation in the rejection of science has implications for science communicators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewandowsky","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Gignac","given":"Gilles E."},{"family":"Oberauer","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"lewandowskyRoleConspiracistIdeation2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0075637","editor":[{"family":"Denson","given":"Tom"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e75637","source":"Crossref","title":"The Role of Conspiracist Ideation and Worldviews in Predicting Rejection of Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075637","volume":"8"},

We theorized and tested the hypothesis that Protestants would endorse internal attributions to a greater extent than would Catholics, because Protestantism focuses on the inward condition of the soul. In Study 1, Protestants made more internal, but not external, attributions than did Catholics. This effect survived controlling for Protestant work ethic, need for structure, and intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. Study 2 showed that the Protestant–Catholic difference in internal attributions was significantly mediated by Protestants' greater belief in a soul. In Study 3, priming religion increased belief in a soul for Protestants but not for Catholics. Finally, Study 4 found that experimentally strengthening belief in a soul increased dispositional attributions among Protestants but did not change situational attributions. These studies expand the understanding of cultural differences in attributions by demonstrating a distinct effect of religion on dispositional attributions.

But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's book The Paranoid Style in American Politics to doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (total N = 5049)—including national samples—we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (r = .27, 95% CI: .24, .30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges' g = .77, SE = .07, p < .001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Linden","given":"Sander","dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Panagopoulos","given":"Costas"},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Flávio"},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"lindenParanoidStyleAmerican2021","container-title":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/pops.12681","ISSN":"1467-9221","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"23-51","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Paranoid Style in American Politics Revisited: An Ideological Asymmetry in Conspiratorial Thinking","title-short":"The Paranoid Style in American Politics Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12681","volume":"42"},

In the present research, we investigate “need for explanation” and “mystery acceptability” across the domains of science and religion, as a window onto differences between scientific and religious cognition more broadly. In Study 1, we find that scientific “why” questions are judged to be in greater need of explanation and less adequately answered by appeals to mystery than religious “why” questions. Moreover, this holds for both religious believers and non-believers. In Study 2, we find that these domain differences persist after statistically controlling for confidence in the premises of scientific and religious \"why\" questions (e.g., that “the Earth goes around the Sun” and that “there is a God”). In Study 3, we match levels of confidence within-participants, and we find that domain differences in need for explanation and mystery acceptability are systematically related to domain differences in epistemic commitments (whether an explanation is within human comprehension, whether the same explanation is true for everyone) and explanatory norms (whether an explanation should be pursued), which could signal domain differences in epistemic and social functions, respectively. Together, these studies shed light on the role of explanatory inquiry across domains, and point to different functional roles for scientific and religious cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liquin","given":"Emily G."},{"family":"Metz","given":"S.

We examined how people justified their agreement with statements regarding evolution, climate change, genetically modified foods, and vaccinations. Participants rated their level of agreement with statements reflecting the scientific consensus on these topics, then responded to open-ended questions asking them to justify their position and to generate challenges to their belief. Responses to individual difference measures allowed us to assess the relationship between participants’ positions on these scientific issues and cognitive style, conspiracy ideation, religious service attendance, and political ideology. Qualitative analyses revealed inconsistent and topic-specific patterns of reasoning. Additionally, greater agreement with scientific conclusions was related to a greater predisposition towards analytical thinking and stronger self-reported political liberalism. These findings provide a next step for better understanding why some individuals reject science and for developing more effective means of improving science acceptance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lobato","given":"Emilio J.

In a novel extension examining standards of evidence with respect to failures of replication, we found that religious individuals were consistent across domains, whereas nonreligious individuals indicated a lower threshold for rejecting religious claims relative to scientific claims.

Recent research, however, suggests that these judgments may be pivotal to conceptual change about certain topics where a gap exists between what scientists and laypersons find plausible. Based on a philosophical and empirical foundation, this article presents a theoretical model of the role of plausibility judgments in conceptual change (PJCC) with implications for epistemic cognition. The PJCC moves beyond the limitations of cold cognitive processing by incorporating the warmer constructs of affect, motivation, and motivated reasoning. We review recent research in plausibility judgments that informed the PJCC's development and discuss components of the model. Of particular note is the importance of using explicit critical evaluation to reappraise plausibility judgments that may have been originally made through implicit cognitive processes. We also suggest potentially productive areas of future research based on the PJCC model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lombardi","given":"Doug"},{"family":"Nussbaum","given":"E.

In particular, students may be more likely to accept evolution if they understand that a scientific theory is provisional but reliable, that scientists employ diverse methods for testing scientific claims, and that relating data to theory can require inference and interpretation. In a study with university undergraduates, we find that accepting evolution is significantly correlated with understanding the nature of science, even when controlling for the effects of general interest in science and past science education. These results highlight the importance of understanding the nature of science for accepting evolution.

This article examines this assumption using four distinct questions asked on the third wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). Results indicate a variety of viewpoints for constructing the relationship between science and religion, rather than a simple conflict-compatibility continuum. Further, findings suggest that increased religiousness among emerging adults is associated with a stronger agreement in science and religion’s compatibility, rather than conflict. Incorporating New Age or non-Western spiritual tradition and a strict adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine are associated with complex configurations of beliefs on the relationship between religion and science. Collectively, the findings among emerging adults contradict traditional assumptions about how religious experiences influence beliefs, suggesting that such social factors may influence beliefs and attitudes uniquely at different points in the lifecourse or across generations. More broadly, the findings speak to the ongoing debate about the extent to which differing social experiences may produce consistent or discordant sets of beliefs and values, and in turn how particular configurations may impact strategies of action across a range of life domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Longest","given":"Kyle C."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"longestConflictingCompatibleBeliefs2011","container-title":"Sociological Forum","DOI":"10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01287.x","ISSN":"1573-7861","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"846-869","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conflicting or Compatible: Beliefs About Religion and Science Among Emerging Adults in the United States","title-short":"Conflicting or Compatible","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01287.x","volume":"26"},

We suggest that only the most dogmatic and fundamentalistic type of religiousness could lead to conspiracy beliefs, while centrality of religiosity could be unrelated or even negatively related to this type of thinking. In a series of two studies (N = 361 and N = 394) conducted among Polish Roman Catholics, we demonstrate that religious fundamentalism, unlike centrality of religiosity, is positively related to coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, which, in turn, promote socially maladaptive behavior such as freeriding or non-adherence to safety guidelines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Łowicki","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Marchlewska","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Molenda","given":"Zuzanna"},{"family":"Karakula","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Szczepańska","given":"Dagmara"}],"citation-key":"lowickiDoesReligionPredict2022","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2021.111413","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"111413","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Does religion predict coronavirus conspiracy beliefs?

  {"id":"luttrellStabilityMoralizedAttitudes2020","abstract":"When people perceive a moral basis for an attitude, that attitude tends to remain durable when directly challenged. But are moral concerns only influential in the moment or does moralization also signal an attitude that endures over time? Five longitudinal studies considering attitudes toward 19 different topics tested whether attitudes are more stable over time when people report that they are more morally based. Across studies, we find support for the hypothesis that degree of attitude moralization moderates the consistency of attitude reports over time with more moralized attitudes being more stable. These effects of moralization also hold when controlling for other metacognitive predictors of attitude strength, including certainty, ambivalence, importance, knowledge, ease of retrieval, and self-definition. An analysis of all studies together supports the reliability of the hypothesized effect but also suggests that it varies by topic.

  {"id":"ma-kellamsDoesScienceMake2013","abstract":"Background Previous work has noted that science stands as an ideological force insofar as the answers it offers to a variety of fundamental questions and concerns; as such, those who pursue scientific inquiry have been shown to be concerned with the moral and social ramifications of their scientific endeavors. No studies to date have directly investigated the links between exposure to science and moral or prosocial behaviors. Methodology/Principal Findings Across four studies, both naturalistic measures of science exposure and experimental primes of science led to increased adherence to moral norms and more morally normative behaviors across domains. Study 1 (n = 36) tested the natural correlation between exposure to science and likelihood of enforcing moral norms. Studies 2 (n = 49), 3 (n = 52), and 4 (n = 43) manipulated thoughts about science and examined the causal impact of such thoughts on imagined and actual moral behavior. Across studies, thinking about science had a moralizing effect on a broad array of domains, including interpersonal violations (Studies 1, 2), prosocial intentions (Study 3), and economic exploitation (Study 4). Conclusions/Significance These studies demonstrated the morally normative effects of lay notions of science. Thinking about science leads individuals to endorse more stringent moral norms and exhibit more morally normative behavior. These studies are the first of their kind to systematically and empirically test the relationship between science and morality. The present findings speak to this question and elucidate the value-laden outcomes of the notion of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma-Kellams","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Blascovich","given":"Jim"}],"citation-key":"ma-kellamsDoesScienceMake2013","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0057989","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e57989","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Does “Science” Make You Moral?

The ESI-R measures a five factor model of spirituality developed through the conjoint factor analysis of several extant measures of spiritual constructs. Exploratory factor analyses of pooled data provided evidence that the five ESI-R factors are reliable. Confirmatory analyses comparing four and five factor models revealed that the five dimensional model demonstrates superior goodness-of-fit with all cultural samples and suggest that the ESI-R may be viewed as structurally invariant. Measurement invariance, however, was not supported as manifested in significant differences in item and dimension scores and in significantly poorer fit when factor loadings were constrained to equality across all samples. Exploratory analyses with a second adjective measure of spirituality using American, Indian, and Ugandan samples identified three replicable factors which correlated with ESI-R dimensions in a manner supportive of convergent validity.

While high levels of hesitancy lead to low vaccine demand, low levels of hesitancy do not necessarily mean high vaccine demand.

Conspicuous differences at the doctrinal, metaphysical, methodological and attitudinal level are noted. Regarding these aspects, closer examination reveals that science and religion are not only different but in fact incompatible. Some consequences of our analysis for education as well as for education policy are explored. We submit that a religious education, particularly at an early age, is an obstacle to the development of a scientific mentality. For this and other reasons, religious education should be kept away from public schools and universities.

In this regard, we view neorealism has problems. After Waltz’s theory of defensive neorealism, Mearsheimer’s theory is becoming the ideology of IR to make sense of world politics, especially in Indonesia where scholars of IR mostly quote Mearsheimer as the master who knows deeply, the Russia-Ukraine War. By using the critical theory approach, we argue that the theory of offensive neorealism is ideological because this theory is believed as a ‘faith’ to make sense of the reality of the Russia-Ukraine War without questioning the epistemological and methodological assumptions.

Our idea combines behavioral effects generated by a dominated option, together with more traditional tools, such as providing information and recommendations. Methods. Making use of the seasonal nature of the flu, our treatments present participants with 2 options to receive the shot: early in the season, which is recommended and hence “attractive,” or later. Three additional layers are examined: 1) mentioning that the vaccine is more likely to run out of stock late in the season, 2) the early shot is free while the late one costs a fee, and 3) the early shot carries a monetary benefit. We compare vaccination intentions in these treatments to those of a control group who were invited to receive the shot regardless of timing. Results. Using a sample of the Israeli adult population (n = 3271), we found positive effects of all treatments on vaccination intentions, and these effects were significant for 3 of the 4 treatments. In addition, the vast majority of those who are willing to vaccinate intend to get the early shot. Conclusions. Introducing 2 options to get vaccinated against influenza (early or late) positively affects intentions to receive the flu shot.

But this observation is complicated by remarkably positive and stable attitudes toward scientific research itself. What explains the persistence of positive belief in science in the midst of such dramatic change? By leveraging research on the performativity of conservative identity, we argue that conservative scientific institutions have manufactured a scientific cultural repertoire that enables participation in this highly valued epistemological space while undermining scientific authority perceived as politically biased. We test our hypothesized link between conservative identity and scientific perceptions using panel data from the General Social Survey. We find that those with stable conservative identities hold more positive attitudes toward scientific research while simultaneously holding more negative attitudes towards the scientific community compared to those who switch to and from conservative political identities. These findings support a theory of a conservative scientific repertoire that is learned over time and that helps orient political conservatives in scientific debates that have political repercussions. Implications of these findings are discussed for researchers interested in the cultural differentiation of scientific authority and for stakeholders in scientific communication and its public policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Schleifer","given":"Cyrus"}],"citation-key":"mannLoveScienceHate2020","container-title":"Social Forces","container-title-short":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.1093/sf/soz156","ISSN":"0037-7732","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,5]]},"page":"305-332","source":"Silverchair","title":"Love the Science, Hate the Scientists: Conservative Identity Protects Belief in Science and Undermines Trust in Scientists","title-short":"Love the Science, Hate the Scientists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soz156","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"mansourScienceTeachersViews2011","abstract":"This paper reports a study that explores Egyptian science teachers' views on religion and science within the context of Islam. It also highlights an ontological and epistemological consideration of these views, particularly the ways through which Egyptian Muslim teachers understand such a relationship with reference to the Qur'anic/Islamic attitude toward science and knowledge. The study built upon Barbour's categorization scheme to guide the data collection and analysis and to guide the interpretation of the teachers' responses in the interviews. Informed by a multigrounded theory of the teachers' views of science and religion, and using Roth and Alexander's analytical framework to interpret how teachers accommodate the relationship between science and religion within their belief system, the findings suggest that participants' views of the relationship between science and a specific religion (Islam) confirmed the centrality of teachers' personal religious beliefs to their own thoughts and views concerning issues of both science and Islam. This centralization, in some cases, appeared to lead teachers to hold a conflicting relationship, hence to a creation of a false contradiction between science and Islam. Therefore, it could be concluded that teachers' personal Islamic-religious beliefs inform their beliefs about the nature of science and its purpose. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  {"id":"mansourScienceTeachersViews2015","abstract":"Despite a growing consensus regarding the value of inquiry-based learning (IBL) for students’ learning and engagement in the science classroom, the implementation of such practices continues to be a challenge. If science teachers are to use IBL to develop students’ inquiry practices and encourage them to think and act as scientists, a better understanding of factors that influence their attitudes towards scientific research and scientists’ practices is very much needed. Within this context there is a need to re-examine the science teachers’ views of scientists and the cultural factors that might have an impact on teachers’ views and pedagogical practices. A diverse group of Egyptian science teachers took part in a quantitative–qualitative study using a questionnaire and in-depth interviews to explore their views of scientists and scientific research, and to understand how they negotiated their views of scientists and scientific research in the classroom, and how these views informed their practices of using inquiry in the classroom. The findings highlighted how the teachers’ cultural beliefs and views of scientists and scientific research had constructed idiosyncratic pedagogical views and practices. The study suggested implications for further research and argued for teacher professional development based on partnerships with scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mansour","given":"Nasser"}],"citation-key":"mansourScienceTeachersViews2015","container-title":"International Journal of Science Education","DOI":"10.1080/09500693.2015.1049575","ISSN":"0950-0693","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,24]]},"page":"1767-1794","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Science Teachers’ Views and Stereotypes of Religion, Scientists and Scientific Research: A call for scientist–science teacher partnerships to promote inquiry-based learning","title-short":"Science Teachers’ Views and Stereotypes of Religion, Scientists and Scientific Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2015.1049575","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"marchBeliefConspiracyTheories2019","abstract":"A conspiracy theory refers to an alternative explanation of an event involving a conspirator plot organised by powerful people or organisations. Belief in conspiracy theories is related to negative societal outcomes such as poor medical decisions and a decrease in prosocial behaviour. Given these negative outcomes, researchers have explored predictors of belief in conspiracy theories in an attempt to understand and possibly manage these beliefs. In the current study, we explored the utility of personality in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of the odd beliefs/magical thinking subtype of schizotypy, Machiavellianism, grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, primary psychopathy, and secondary psychopathy in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. Participants (N = 230; 44.7% male, 55.3% female) completed an anonymous, confidential online questionnaire which comprised demographics and measures of personality traits and belief in conspiracy theories. The total regression model indicated odd beliefs/magical thinking, trait Machiavellianism, and primary psychopathy were significant, positive predictors of belief in conspiracy theories. No other predictors reached significance. Results of the current study highlight individuals who might be more susceptible to believing conspiracy theories. Specifically, these results indicate that the individual more likely to believe in conspiracy theories may have unusual patterns of thinking and cognitions, be strategic and manipulative, and display interpersonal and affective deficits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"March","given":"Evita"},{"family":"Springer","given":"Jordan"}],"citation-key":"marchBeliefConspiracyTheories2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0225964","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e0225964","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Belief in conspiracy theories: The predictive role of schizotypy, Machiavellianism, and primary psychopathy","title-short":"Belief in conspiracy theories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225964","volume":"14"},

Thus, they should be attractive to individuals who are intolerant of uncertainty and seek cognitive closure. We hypothesized that need for cognitive closure (NFCC) should foster conspiracy beliefs about events that lack clear official explanations, especially when conspiracy theories are temporarily salient. In Experiment 1 NFCC positively predicted the endorsement of a conspiracy theory behind the refugee crisis, especially when conspiratorial explanations were made salient. Experiment 2 showed that when conspiratorial explanations were made salient, NFCC positively predicted beliefs in conspiracies behind a mysterious plane crash. However, the link between NFCC and beliefs in conspiratorial explanations was reversed in the case of a plane crash with an official, nonconspiratorial, explanation for the accident. In conclusion, people high (vs. low) in NFCC seize on conspiratorial explanations for uncertain events when such explanations are situationally accessible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Marchlewska","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Cichocka","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Kossowska","given":"Małgorzata"}],"citation-key":"marchlewskaAddictedAnswersNeed2018","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Eur.

In this paper we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N=1019; Study 2 N=223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one’s religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs.

  {"id":"mariConspiracyTheoriesInstitutional2022","abstract":"A generalized climate of distrust in political institutions is not functional to healthy democracies. With the advent of social media, recent scholarly efforts attempt to better understand people's conspiracy theory beliefs in inhibiting institutional trust. This study contributes to this literature by considering the direct antecedent effects of uncertainty avoidance and the moderating role of active social media use—SMU (i.e., interactional SMU, informational SMU, and political expressive SMU). The former is theorized to enable conspiracy theories to thrive, while the latter should cushion the negative effects of conspiracy beliefs on institutional trust. Relying on diverse survey data across different cultures from Europe, the Americas, and New Zealand (N = 11,958) and applying structural equation modeling, findings supported the hypothesized model. In high uncertainty-avoidance societies, where less well-known situations are perceived as uncomfortable or downright threatening, conspiracy beliefs proliferate and negatively impact institutional trust. Active SMU attenuates these effects. Via social media, citizens have the ability to strengthen social relationships (interactional SMU), keep themselves informed about the community (informational SMU), and engage in political self-expression (political expressive SMU), which mitigate conspiracy-belief negative effects on institutional trust. Future research implications and key limitations of the study are all discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Mari","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Gil de Zúñiga","given":"Homero"},{"family":"Suerdem","given":"Ahmet"},{"family":"Hanke","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Vilar","given":"Roosevelt"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Bilewicz","given":"Michal"}],"citation-key":"mariConspiracyTheoriesInstitutional2022","container-title":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/pops.12754","ISSN":"1467-9221","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"277-296","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conspiracy Theories and Institutional Trust: Examining the Role of Uncertainty Avoidance and Active Social Media Use","title-short":"Conspiracy Theories and Institutional Trust","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12754","volume":"43"},

This study examined how epistemic and ontological cognition predict agreement with four science-religion perspectives: conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration. Participants (N = 3911) were Finnish, Danish, and Dutch adults who had answered an online study. Most people held views that were not well captured by the commonly used four categories. When more specific perspectives were examined, differences were found especially in supernatural beliefs, over-mentalizing, and justifications for religious arguments and scientific knowledge.

  {"id":"martinez-condeOpinionFindingPlot2017","abstract":"Like the proverbial tree falling in a forest with no one around to hear it, science discoveries cannot have an impact unless people learn about them. The act of communication is part and parcel of doing research. And in an era increasingly defined by open access, crowdfunding, and citizen science endeavors, there is a growing demand for researchers to communicate their findings not just within their field—via institutional seminars, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed publications—but to general audiences as well. One of our main endeavors as scientists then, must be to present discoveries about which the public will care.\n\n\n\nStorytelling and narrative can help communicate science to nonexperts and improve the odds of science communication success. Image courtesy of Dave Cutler (artist).\n\n\n\nBorrowing communication strategies from the arts and humanities can help, and scientists would be wise to do so more often. As recent scholarship in science communications has suggested, an “information deficit” is not, by itself, the root cause of a poor understanding of science among portions of the lay public (1). Simply providing more information about a given issue won’t necessarily change minds or prompt, for example, a skeptical audience to accept the science of climate change.\n\nRecent work indicates that storytelling and narrative can help communicate science to nonexperts (2), within the wider context of “framing” as an important feature of public outreach. Creative writing—and fictional storytelling—offer clues on how to improve our odds of science communication success. Pursuing such strategies can help tackle what continues to be a monumental science communications challenge.\n\nAs noted in a recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on the state-of-the-art of science communication, the complexities that stand in the way of effective science communication are many, varied, and very often interdependent (3).

Our analysis indicates that variability in direct experience cannot explain belief disparities between science and religion, within each domain, or across cultures.

This belief persists despite overwhelming evidence that Islamist radicals were the true perpetrators. The current research examines the role intergroup threats and negative emotions have in moulding this type of conspiratorial belief, and how this role is dependent upon the level of Muslims’ perceived identity subversion, that is, a sense that the Western ways of life have fundamentally changed Islamic identity. Data from 246 Indonesian Muslim students revealed that negative emotions of dejection-agitation towards Western ways of life significantly mediated the effects of both symbolic and realistic threats on belief in anti-West conspiracy theories. The effects of intergroup threats and dejection-agitation on belief in conspiracy theories, as predicted, were contingent on Muslim participants’ perceived identity subversion. Higher symbolic threat, realistic threat and dejection-agitation, indeed, positively predicted the belief, but only when the degree of identity subversion was high. Identity subversion moderated the roles of dejection-agitation in mediating the effect of symbolic and realistic threats in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. More specifically, the empirical evidence of these mediating roles of dejection-agitation was only among Muslim participants with high identity subversion.

  {"id":"massonTurningGodsTranshumanist2014","abstract":"Transhumanism has been a part of modern culture since the early years of the twentieth century. Since Julian Huxley, (brother of the famous writer Aldous Huxley), first used the term in 1957 to describe what he called a \"new belief \" in the capability of the human species to \"transcend itself,\" transhumanism has been going through a continuous institutionalization process. After spending the second half of the twentieth century as a major leitmotiv of science fiction, since the dawn of the new millennium a large number of texts dealing with the creation of a new human species have been published as non-fiction: thus, what was considered a few years ago to be genuine science fiction themes, are now presented as non-fiction. However much this crossover from fictional to non-fictional may have changed the face of transhumanism, it has nevertheless left intact its narrative dimension. In this article we argue that this narrative is what gives transhumanism its implicit religious dimension.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Masson","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"massonTurningGodsTranshumanist2014","container-title":"Implicit Religion","DOI":"10.1558/imre.v17i4.443","ISSN":"14639955","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]},"page":"443-458","publisher":"Equinox Publishing Group","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Turning into Gods: Transhumanist Insight on Tomorrow's Religiosity","title-short":"Turning into Gods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=100792581&site=ehost-live","volume":"17"},

We interviewed 20 academic geneticists in the United States about their perceptions of the roles they and others (e.g., professional societies, the public, ethicists, and elected officials) do and should play in the formation of science policy, the communication of science to the public, and the public discussions of moral and ethical issues raised by scientific advances. The participants in our study thought that scientists should be more actively involved in public outreach and science policy formation, but frequently they felt ill-equipped and unsupported by their peers and institutions to pursue these activities. Furthermore, many were skeptical of or did not trust elected officials—who they consider uninformed about the issues and too driven by political agendas—to formulate sound science policy. They do, however, have faith in the ability of scientific societies to influence policy effectively, and some thought that societies should play a larger role, both in science policy and as a liaison between scientists and the public. Finally, participants offered suggestions for increasing the involvement and influence of scientists in science-policy formation and public discourse. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathews","given":"Debra J.H."},{"family":"Kalfoglou","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Kathy"}],"citation-key":"mathewsGeneticistsViewsScience2005","container-title":"American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A","DOI":"10.1002/ajmg.a.30849","ISSN":"1552-4833","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","page":"161-169","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geneticists' views on science policy formation and public outreach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajmg.a.30849","volume":"137A"},

Dissemination of results are straightforward when the findings are positive, but what happens when you obtain results that support the null hypothesis, or do not fit with the current scientific thinking?

We argue that, for conceptual as well as empirical reasons, norms and consequences should be considered as more intimately linked with one another than their systematic juxtaposition in dilemma research may suggest, and propose that norm-endorsement should be viewed through a consequentialist lens as well. Investigating this proposal, we introduce a variant of the CNI model of moral dilemma judgment, which focuses on the use of proscriptive norms only. In five experiments, we validate this proCNI model and assess the parameters’ sensitivity to different types of consequences and personal involvement. Our findings suggest that the parameter representing “norms” is sensitive to consequences as well, such that norms do not guide moral judgment unless they are expected to produce tangible consequences. Thus, present research suggests that the split between norms and “consequences” (or “deontology” and “utilitarianism”) as determinants of judgment is artificial. We suggest that, ultimately, viewing dilemma judgments through a consequentialist lens may be a useful approach for advancing theoretical development in the field of dilemma research.

I describe the various reduction strategies that have been investigated followed by models that have been proposed to understand an individual's use of dissonance reduction strategies. I then highlight a series of factors that can help us move research about dissonance reduction forward. These factors can be broadly subsumed under characteristics of the reduction mode and characteristics of the dissonance arousal.

We investigated a potential cultural mechanism for the transmission of confidence in the existence of invisible entities. Specifically, we asked whether parents in societies with markedly different religious profiles—Iran and China—signal differential confidence across the domains of science and religion during unmoderated conversations with their children (N = 120 parent-child dyads in total; 5- to 11-year-olds). The results revealed that parents used fewer lexical cues to uncertainty when discussing scientific phenomena, as compared to religious phenomena. Unsurprisingly, this cross-domain distinction was observed among majority belief, secular parents in China (Study 2). More importantly, however, the same pattern was observed among parents in Iran, a highly religious society (Study 1), as well as among minority belief, religious parents in China (Study 2). Thus, adults in markedly different belief communities spontaneously express less confidence in religious, as compared to scientific, invisible entities in naturalistic conversation.

  {"id":"mcphetresReflectingGodsWill2018","abstract":"Religious people tend to reject harm on moral dilemmas where causing harm maximizes outcomes, which is consistent with deontological but not utilitarian philosophy. Past research suggests that non-reﬂective processes drive deontological judgments, such as aﬀective reactions to harm or heuristic application of moral rules. Yet, for religious people, reﬂective processes may also play a role in driving deontological judgments. We examined this possibility in three studies. Unlike most research, which treats deontological and utilitarian responses as diametric opposites, we employed process dissociation to assess them independently. Religiosity was associated with increased deontological and reduced utilitarian response tendencies—but time pressure (Study 1) and cognitive load (Study 2) reduced deontological tendencies among religious people. Increasing the salience of religious values attenuated this eﬀect, without impacting utilitarian tendencies or the responses of less-religious people (Study 3). Thus, reﬂective consideration of religious values may contribute to deontological response tendencies among religious people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McPhetres","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Conway","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Jamie S."},{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Miron"}],"citation-key":"mcphetresReflectingGodsWill2018","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jesp.2018.08.013","ISSN":"00221031","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"301-314","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reflecting on God's will: Reflective processing contributes to religious peoples' deontological dilemma responses","title-short":"Reflecting on God's will","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022103117308260","volume":"79"},

  {"id":"mcphetresReligiousPeopleEndorse2017","abstract":"Recent research has begun to investigate the relationship between religion and science. However, it remains unclear whether religious and nonreligious people differ on the standards of evidence used when evaluating claims in religious versus scientific contexts. Across three studies (N ¼ 702), we presented participants with effects that were attributed to scientific methodology or to God and asked them to rate how many more times an effect needs to be repeated in order to have certainty in the outcome. Results showed that religious people requested fewer repetitions compared to nonreligious people when an effect was attributed to prayer, and fewer repetitions when an effect was attributed to prayer compared to scientific methodology. Nonreligious people were relatively consistent across conditions. These results suggest that religious people have less stringent standards of evidence when evaluating nonscientific claims.

  {"id":"mcphetresUsingFindingsCognitive2018","abstract":"The body of research looking at the public understanding and acceptance of science has been growing in recent years. Here, we argue that religiosity is one important factor influencing the perception and understanding of science and scientific information. In the present article, we review recent literature with the goal of answering three questions: what is the relationship between science and religion, when do science and religion conflict, and why do these conflicts exist? To answer these questions, we turn to research from the cognitive science of religion. Specifically, we argue that, while some conflicts between religion and science result from moral and epistemological contradictions, these conflicts also stem partially from cognitive mechanisms underpinning religious beliefs and scientific understanding. We review research suggesting that the same cognitive processes responsible for religious and supernatural beliefs may contribute to the rejection of science. We discuss this evidence in terms of its social and scientific implications, how it can inform our understanding of the relationship between religion and science, and how it can guide future study on this important topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McPhetres","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Thuy-vy T."}],"citation-key":"mcphetresUsingFindingsCognitive2018","container-title":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/2153599x.2017.1326399","ISSN":"2153-599X, 2153-5981","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,2]]},"language":"en","page":"394-405","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using findings from the cognitive science of religion to understand current conflicts between religious and scientific ideologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2017.1326399","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"meadTeachingGeneticsPrior2017","abstract":"What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be configured as a branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap from understanding the concepts of mutation and alleles (i.e., genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution), we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve student understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and evolution are typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes with a large time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a large trial into teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified extant questionnaires to ascertain students’ understanding of evolution and genetics along with acceptance of evolution. Students were assessed prior to teaching, immediately post teaching and again after several months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just to teach in a given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding and acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly, teaching genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p < 0.001) impact on improving evolution understanding by 7% in questionnaire scores beyond the increase seen for those taught in the inverse order. For lower ability students, an improvement in evolution understanding was seen only if genetics was taught first. Teaching genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple, minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution understanding: teach genetics first. This same alteration does not, however, result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution, which reflects a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance of evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights the role of authority figures in determination of acceptance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mead","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Hejmadi","given":"Momna"},{"family":"Hurst","given":"Laurence D."}],"citation-key":"meadTeachingGeneticsPrior2017","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.2002255","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e2002255","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Teaching genetics prior to teaching evolution improves evolution understanding but not acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002255","volume":"15"},

Others, in contrast, hoped replication efforts could improve public confidence in science. Yet nationally representative evidence backing these concerns or hopes is scarce. We provide such evidence, conducting a secondary analysis of the German “Science Barometer” (“Wissenschaftsbarometer”) survey. We find that most Germans are not aware of the “replication crisis.” In addition, most interpret replication efforts as indicative of scientific quality control and science’s self-correcting nature. However, supporters of the populist right-wing party AfD tend to believe that the “crisis” shows one cannot trust science, perhaps using it as an argument to discredit science. But for the majority of Germans, hopes about reputational benefits of the “replication crisis” for science seem more justified than concerns about detrimental effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mede","given":"Niels G."},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Ricarda"},{"family":"Weißkopf","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"medeReplicationCrisisPublic2021","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10/ghzshk","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"91-102","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The “replication crisis” in the public eye: Germans’ awareness and perceptions of the (ir)reproducibility of scientific research","title-short":"The “replication crisis” in the public eye","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520954370","volume":"30"},

Scholars have stated that it is characteristic for political populism to describe society as a fundamental struggle between an allegedly virtuous people and political elites which are portrayed negatively. This anti-elitist sentiment not only targets politicians, however, but also other representatives of the alleged establishment—including scientists and scholarly institutions. But the specifics of such science-related populism have not yet been conceptualized. We aim to do so, integrating scholarship on political populism, the “participatory turn,” and alternative epistemologies. We propose to conceptualize science-related populism as a set of ideas which suggests that there is a morally charged antagonism between an (allegedly) virtuous ordinary people and an (allegedly) unvirtuous academic elite, and that this antagonism is due to the elite illegitimately claiming and the people legitimately demanding both science-related decision-making sovereignty and truth-speaking sovereignty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Mede","given":"Niels G."},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Mike S."}],"citation-key":"medeSciencerelatedPopulismConceptualizing2020","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662520924259","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"473-491","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Science-related populism: Conceptualizing populist demands toward science","title-short":"Science-related populism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520924259","volume":"29"},

One possible explanation might be that the motivation to behave in environmentally friendly ways is undermined by the way scientiﬁc progress is overstated in the popular media. Four experiments show that portraying science as rapidly progressing—and thus enabling society to control problems related to the natural environment and human health in the not-too-distant future—is detrimental to environmentally friendly behaviour because such a frame afﬁrms perceptions of an orderly (vs chaotic) world. This in turn negatively affects the likelihood of engaging in environmentally friendly behaviour. Simultaneously, communication that questions (vs afﬁrms) scientiﬁc progress leads to lower perceptions of order and consequential increases in environmentally friendly behaviour. These ﬁndings show that when the aim is to promote environmentally friendly attitudes and behaviour, it helps to not overstate scientiﬁc progress.

  {"id":"mercierHowGullibleAre2017","abstract":"A long tradition of scholarship, from ancient Greece to Marxism or some contemporary social psychology, portrays humans as strongly gullible—wont to accept harmful messages by being unduly deferent. However, if humans are reasonably well adapted, they should not be strongly gullible: they should be vigilant toward communicated information. Evidence from experimental psychology reveals that humans are equipped with well-functioning mechanisms of epistemic vigilance. They check the plausibility of messages against their background beliefs, calibrate their trust as a function of the source's competence and benevolence, and critically evaluate arguments offered to them. Even if humans are equipped with well-functioning mechanisms of epistemic vigilance, an adaptive lag might render them gullible in the face of new challenges, from clever marketing to omnipresent propaganda. I review evidence from different cultural domains often taken as proof of strong gullibility: religion, demagoguery, propaganda, political campaigns, advertising, erroneous medical beliefs, and rumors. Converging evidence reveals that communication is much less influential than often believed—that religious proselytizing, propaganda, advertising, and so forth are generally not very effective at changing people's minds. Beliefs that lead to costly behavior are even less likely to be accepted. Finally, it is also argued that most cases of acceptance of misguided communicated information do not stem from undue deference, but from a fit between the communicated information and the audience's preexisting beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mercier","given":"Hugo"}],"citation-key":"mercierHowGullibleAre2017","container-title":"Review of General Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/gpr0000111","ISSN":"1089-2680","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"103-122","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"How Gullible are We?

Our hypothesis is that people engage in self-protective behavior against an infectious disease when they are: fearful about things in general; trustful of government's ability to control the disease outbreak; and anticipating a direct threat to their health. The self-protective behavior we examine is the intention to accept a prospective anti-Ebola vaccination. We examine these relationships with basic demographic variables taken into account: gender, age, ethnicity, race and education. The data source is a national random sample of 1,018 United States adults interviewed early during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. We constructed a new three-item Exposure Expectancy Scale (alpha = 0. 635) to measure the degree of respondents' expectancy of a potential nearby Ebola outbreak. Our data analysis employs multiple logistic regressions. The findings support our hypothesis: willingness to take the Ebola vaccination is positively associated with a generalized sense of fear, trust in the government's ability to control an outbreak of the disease, and expectation of a potential Ebola outbreak that is imminent and proximate. The addition of the exposure expectancy variable in this analysis adds significantly to our understanding of contributors to vaccine hesitancy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mesch","given":"Gustavo S."},{"family":"Schwirian","given":"Kent P."}],"citation-key":"meschVaccinationHesitancyFear2019","container-title":"Heliyon","container-title-short":"Heliyon","DOI":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02016","ISSN":"2405-8440","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e02016","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Vaccination hesitancy: fear, trust, and exposure expectancy of an Ebola outbreak","title-short":"Vaccination hesitancy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019356762","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"metzDistinctProfilesBeliefs2023","abstract":"A growing body of research suggests that scientific and religious beliefs are often held and justified in different ways. In three studies with 707 participants, we examine the distinctive profiles of beliefs in these domains. In Study 1, we find that participants report evidence and explanatory considerations (making sense of things) as dominant reasons for beliefs across domains. However, cuing the religious domain elevates endorsement of nonscientific justifications for belief, such as ethical considerations (e.g., believing it encourages people to be good), affiliation (what loved ones believe), and intuition (what feels true in one's heart). Study 2 replicates these differences with specific scientific and religious beliefs held with equal confidence, and documents further domain differences in beliefs’ personal importance, openness to revision, and perceived objectivity. Study 3 replicates these differences, further finding that counter-consensus beliefs about contentious science topics (such as climate change and vaccination) often have properties resembling religious beliefs, while counter-religious beliefs about religion (e.g., “There is no God”) have properties that more closely resemble beliefs about science. We suggest that beliefs are held and justified within coherent epistemic frameworks, with individuals using different frameworks in different contexts and domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Metz","given":"S.

They are taken as starting point to examine what the theory of secularization predicts and which predictions have been confirmed. It is shown that the three canonical theories of the change of religiosity-secularization, individualization, and market theory-are identical in their structure und can be integrated as the secularization theory. The secularization theory has been tested in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, and by macro and multi-level analyses-that is, cross-classfied in four forms. Neglecting cross-sectional macro analyses, there are only 11 publications within the three remaining forms. They confirm a negative effect of social differentiation throughout und a negative effect of cultural pluralization often. Yet they often fail to control for important micro impacts upon religiosity, such as denomination or parenthood.

  {"id":"mietznerPopulistAntiScientismReligious2020","abstract":"There is widespread agreement that compared to most other states in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s central government has offered a poor response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The government of President Joko Widodo initially ignored the threat, and when it did react, the crisis policies were piecemeal and confusing. But what explains this outcome? It would be easy to attribute Indonesia’s response to its lower middle-income status or its democratic governance structures that lack strong repressive capacity. With countries poorer and more democratic than Indonesia performing better, however, this explanation is unsatisfactory. Going beyond simple development and regime categories, this article proposes that Indonesia’s COVID-19 response was the result of its specific process of democratic decline in the last decade. This backsliding produced intensifying populist anti-scientism, religious conservatism, religio-political polarisation, corruption and clientelism, as well as assertiveness among anti-democratic actors. Ultimately, these segmental factors combined into a toxic mix that severely constrained Indonesia’s ability to effectively respond to a massive external shock such as COVID-19.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mietzner","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"mietznerPopulistAntiScientismReligious2020","container-title":"Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs","container-title-short":"Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs","DOI":"10/gg7m8h","ISSN":"1868-1034","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"227-249","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Populist Anti-Scientism, Religious Polarisation, and Institutionalised Corruption: How Indonesia’s Democratic Decline Shaped Its COVID-19 Response","title-short":"Populist Anti-Scientism, Religious Polarisation, and Institutionalised Corruption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1868103420935561","volume":"39"},

The category differentiation (reduction) model received the most support insofar as (a) it rendered predictions of intergroup evaluations that were significant and of moderate magnitude, and (b) these predictions varied as a significant function of the proposed underlying mechanism for the model (the similarity between the categorization dimensions).

However, although we know much about the psychological antecedents of conspiracy endorsement, we know less about the individual-level political causes of these prevalent and consequential beliefs. Our work draws from the extant literature to posit that endorsement of conspiracy theories is a motivated process that serves both ideological and psychological needs. In doing so, we develop a theory that identifies a particular type of person—one who is both highly knowledgeable about politics and lacking in trust—who is most susceptible to ideologically motivated conspiracy endorsement. Further, we demonstrate that the moderators of belief in conspiracy theories are strikingly different for conservatives and liberals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Joanne M."},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Kyle L."},{"family":"Farhart","given":"Christina E."}],"citation-key":"millerConspiracyEndorsementMotivated2016","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12234","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2015, Midwest Political Science Association","page":"824-844","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conspiracy Endorsement as Motivated Reasoning: The Moderating Roles of Political Knowledge and Trust","title-short":"Conspiracy Endorsement as Motivated Reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12234","volume":"60"},

Study Design and Setting: We performed a systematic literature search of studies identiﬁed in 10 electronic databases. Two independent reviewers selected the relevant abstracts and articles, then extracted information. Content analysis methodology was used to create a coding template for barriers and then to identify how many studies identiﬁed speciﬁc barriers.\nResults: Fifteen studies were included in this overview. Eight studies used semistructured interviews, ﬁve used focus groups, and two used both methodologies. Themes fell under four major headings: issues of harm, issues of distrust, access issues, and other issues. Barriers identiﬁed in more than half of the studies included concern about the risk of adverse effects, concern that vaccinations are painful, distrust of by those advocating vaccines (including belief in conspiracy), belief that vaccination should not occur when the child has a minor illness, unpleasant staff or poor communication, and lack of awareness of the vaccination schedule.\nConclusion: Systematically reviewing qualitative studies on barriers to childhood vaccination provided important information on barriers that are consistently identiﬁed by parents in several different studies.

  {"id":"milyavskyPeopleWhoNeed2022","abstract":"We propose a new theoretical model depicting the compensatory relations between personal agency and social assistance. It suggests two general hypotheses, namely that (1) the stronger the individuals’ sense of personal agency, the weaker their motivation to utilize social assistance and the greater their consequent tendency to develop anti-social attitudes. Conversely, (2) the stronger the individuals’ reliance on social assistance, the weaker their motivation to be agentic, and the lesser their tendency to develop a strong sense of self. These relations are assumed to apply across levels of generality, that is, concerning agency and assistance within a single goal domain, as well as across domains where the source of agency (e.g., money, power) or assistance facilitates the attainment of multiple goals. At the time of this writing, the world finds itself in the grip of an unprecedented calamity: the COVID 19 pandemic, the worst such outbreak in living memory. Starting at the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, the virus spread quickly across the planet. Over 37 million persons, globally, have been infected so far and the worst may be yet to come. Over 7.6 million Americans were infected, and over 214,000 died as a consequence. Millions are expected to succumb to the plague, the world economy is taking a historic hit. People are losing jobs, some to be never recovered. Factories and small business are shuttered, many to never reopen. Health systems of the world’s nations are stretched to their limits, social services and functions (transportation, education, entertainment, leisure) are near paralysis. Millions are cooped up in their homes: lonely and disoriented, the structures of their daily routines in shambles. Nobody is exempt. All are vulnerable. These somber circumstances induce a sense of fragility and helplessness in millions of individuals. Their sense of personal agency is severely threatened, their need for assistance and support is much magnified. And a fundamental question to psychological science is what impact this has on people’s social relations, their attachment to others, their interpersonal orientations, and their attitudes. In the present article, we address such questions by reviewing an extensive body of relevant empirical findings in the social psychological literature and proposing an integrative model that offers new perspectives on the phenomena at stake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Milyavsky","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Chernikova","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Ellenberg","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Pierro","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"milyavskyPeopleWhoNeed2022","container-title":"Psychological Inquiry","DOI":"10.1080/1047840X.2022.2037986","ISSN":"1047-840X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,2]]},"page":"1–22","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"People Who Need People (and Some Who Think They Don't): On Compensatory Personal and Social Means of Goal Pursuit","title-short":"People Who Need People (and Some Who Think They Don't)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2022.2037986","volume":"33"},

With social media’s purported role in disseminating anti-vaccine information, it is imperative to understand the drivers of attitudes among participants involved in the vaccination debate on a communication channel critical to the movement: Twitter. Using four years of longitudinal data capturing vaccine discussions on Twitter, we identify users who persistently hold pro and anti attitudes, and those who newly adopt anti attitudes towards vaccination. After gathering each user’s entire Twitter timeline, totaling to over 3 million tweets, we explore differences in the individual narratives across the user cohorts. We find that those with long-term anti-vaccination attitudes manifest conspiratorial thinking, mistrust in government, and are resolute and in-group focused in language. New adoptees appear to be predisposed to form antivaccination attitudes via similar government distrust and general paranoia, but are more social and less certain than their long-term counterparts. We discuss how this apparent predisposition can interact with social media-fueled events to bring newcomers into the anti-vaccination movement. Given the strong base of conspiratorial thinking underlying anti-vaccination attitudes, we conclude by highlighting the need for alternatives to traditional methods of using authoritative sources such as the government when correcting misleading vaccination claims.","author":[{"family":"Mitra","given":"Tanushree"},{"family":"Counts","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Pennebaker","given":"James W"}],"citation-key":"mitraUnderstandingAntiVaccinationAttitudes2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the Tenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2016)","event-place":"Cologne","event-title":"The Tenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2016)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"10","publisher":"The AAAI Press","publisher-place":"Cologne","source":"Zotero","title":"Understanding Anti-Vaccination Attitudes in Social Media","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.aaai.org/Library/ICWSM/icwsm16contents.php"},

Among the possible strategies to cope with the feeling of insecurity that comes with this, religion can play a signiﬁcant role.

The result holds primarily for those who received religious socialization during their childhood, and this reinforces the role of family transmission as a way to shape religious beliefs and behaviours and to provide individuals with religious coping strategies.

  {"id":"mooijmanResistingTemptationGood2018","abstract":"When do people see self-control as a moral issue? We hypothesize that the group-focused “binding” moral values of Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Purity/degradation play a particularly important role in this moralization process. Nine studies provide support for this prediction. First, moralization of self-control goals (e.g., losing weight, saving money) is more strongly associated with endorsing binding moral values than with endorsing individualizing moral values (Care/harm, Fairness/cheating). Second, binding moral values mediate the effect of other group-focused predictors of self-control moralization, including conservatism, religiosity, and collectivism. Third, guiding participants to consider morality as centrally about binding moral values increases moralization of self-control more than guiding participants to consider morality as centrally about individualizing moral values. Fourth, we replicate our core finding that moralization of self-control is associated with binding moral values across studies differing in measures and design—whether we measure the relationship between moral and self-control language across time, the perceived moral relevance of self-control behaviors, or the moral condemnation of self-control failures. Taken together, our findings suggest that self-control moralization is primarily group-oriented and is sensitive to group-oriented cues.

  {"id":"moonReligionSpecial2023","abstract":"Religion makes unique claims (e.g., the existence of supernatural agents) not found in other belief systems, but is religion itself psychologically special? Furthermore, religion is related to many domains of psychological interest, such as morality, health and well-being, self-control, meaning, and death anxiety. Does religion act on these domains via special mechanisms that are unlike secular mechanisms? These could include mechanisms such as beliefs in supernatural agents, providing ultimate meaning, and providing literal immortality. We apply a critical eye to these questions of specialness and conclude that although it is clear that religion is psychologically important, there is not yet strong evidence that it is psychologically special, with the possible exception of its effects on health.

Although most theorists attribute these perceptions to the beliefs of religious targets, religious individuals also differ in behavioral ways that might cue trust. We examined whether perceivers might trust religious targets more because they heuristically associate religion with slow life-history strategies. In three experiments, we found that religious targets are viewed as slow life-history strategists and that these findings are not the result of a universally positive halo effect; that the effect of target religion on trust is significantly mediated by the target?s life-history traits (i.e., perceived reproductive strategy); and that when perceivers have direct information about a target?s reproductive strategy, their ratings of trust are driven primarily by his or her reproductive strategy, rather than religion. These effects operate over and above targets? belief in moralizing gods and offer a novel theoretical perspective on religion and trust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Moon","given":"Jordan W."},{"family":"Krems","given":"Jaimie Arona"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Adam B."}],"citation-key":"moonReligiousPeopleAre2018","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797617753606","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"page":"947-960","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Religious People Are Trusted Because They Are Viewed as Slow Life-History Strategists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797617753606","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"mormannScientificWorldviewsPromises2017","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to show that global scientific promises aka “scientific worldviews” have an interesting history that should be taken into account also for contemporary debates. I argue that the prototypes of many philosophical positions concerning the role of science in society can already be found in the philosophy of science of the 1920s and 1930s. First to be mentioned in this respect is the Scientific World-Conception of the Vienna Circle (The Manifesto) that promised to contribute to the realization of an enlightened, rational, and science-oriented society and culture. The Manifesto was not the only “scientific world-conception” that philosophers and scientists put forward in the 1920s. Also the scientific world-conception of the philosopher and physicist Moritz Schlick, and the Weltanschauung of Sigmund Freud deserve to be mentioned. Additional examples include Carnap's Scientific Humanism and the project of The International Encyclopedia of Unified Science which was related to American pragmatism as well, as is shown by Charles W. Morris and others. Forgotten for a long time, since the beginning of the 21st century, at least some of the Viennese projects are reconsidered in a new wave of “socially engaged philosophy of science.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mormann","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"mormannScientificWorldviewsPromises2017","container-title":"Centaurus","DOI":"10.1111/1600-0498.12159","ISSN":"1600-0498","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"189-203","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Scientific worldviews as promises of science and problems of philosophy of science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1600-0498.12159","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"mottaExplainingScienceFunding2019","abstract":"While most Americans recognize the importance of funding scientific research, many are satisfied with status quo funding, and only a minority see a need for increased federal support. This poses a potential challenge to scientists’ abilities to address complex policy problems, like climate change. Previous correlational research suggests that public opposition to science funding is (at least in part) the result of low levels of knowledge about the basics of science. Leveraging panel data from two nationally representative studies (2008–2014), I show that people who become more interested in science over time but not those who become more knowledgable are more likely to favor increasing public support for scientific research. These results hold when controlling for other known correlates of science funding attitudes (e.g. political ideology, religiosity). I conclude by discussing the potential benefits of prioritizing science communication and science education efforts to increase public science interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Motta","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"mottaExplainingScienceFunding2019","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662518795397","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"161-176","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Explaining science funding attitudes in the United States: The case for science interest","title-short":"Explaining science funding attitudes in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662518795397","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"muisCuriousCaseClimate2015","abstract":"We propose a theoretical model linking students' epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and learning outcomes. The model was tested across two studies with 439 post-secondary students from Canada, the United States, and Germany for Study 1, and 56 students from Canada for Study 2. For Study 1, students self-reported their epistemic beliefs about climate change, read four conflicting documents about the causes and consequences of climate change, self-reported their epistemic emotions and learning strategies used to learn the content, and were given an inference verification test to measure learning. Study 2 used the same procedure but added a think aloud protocol to capture self-regulatory processes and emotions as they occurred. Path analyses revealed that epistemic beliefs served as important antecedents to the epistemic emotions students experienced during learning. Students who believed that the justification of knowledge about climate change requires critical evaluation of multiple sources experienced higher levels of enjoyment and curiosity, and lower levels of boredom when confronted with conflicting information. A belief in the complexity of this knowledge was related to lower levels of confusion, anxiety, and boredom. A belief in the uncertainty of this knowledge predicted lower levels of anxiety and frustration, and a belief in the active construction of knowledge predicted lower levels of confusion. Epistemic emotions predicted the types of learning strategies students used to learn the content and mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. Learning strategies predicted learning outcomes and mediated relations between epistemic emotions and learning outcomes. Implications for research on epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, and students' self-regulated learning are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Muis","given":"Krista R."},{"family":"Pekrun","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Gale M."},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Trevors","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Heddy","given":"Benjamin C."}],"citation-key":"muisCuriousCaseClimate2015","container-title":"Learning and Instruction","container-title-short":"Learning and Instruction","DOI":"10.1016/j.learninstruc.2015.06.003","ISSN":"0959-4752","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"168-183","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The curious case of climate change: Testing a theoretical model of epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, and complex learning","title-short":"The curious case of climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475215300141","volume":"39"},

This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis comparing the effects of crossed categorization on intergroup evaluations with the effects of simple categorization on intergroup evaluations. The crossed categorization paradigm is shown to increase or decrease ingroup bias, depending on how ingroup bias is defined in the crossed categorization paradigm. Moreover, just as in simple categorization, ingroup bias in crossed categorization is shown to be greater when the proportionate size of the ingroup is smaller. However, contrary to the patterns established in simple categorization, the reality of the group categorizations does not increase ingroup bias in crossed categorization.

In Indonesia, globalization is perceived as an objective condition of international life that structures policy choices for state and societal actors. Opinion varies widely, however, over whether globalization is a positive or negative force. Given these differences, it is argued that the most fruitful way to understand globalization in Indonesia is to analyze the responses of state and societal actors toward the three values promoted in the current era of globalization: liberal capitalism; democracy; and respect for human rights. The responses of the Suharto, Habibie, and Wahid administrations to global pressures for economic liberalization, democracy, and human rights are reviewed to illustrate that Indonesian policy toward globalization has varied over time.

  {"id":"myers-scottonCommonUncommonGround1993","abstract":"The social forces affecting the performance of codeswitching (CS) may be distinguished from those factors controlling its basic structure, with which they interact. The constraints on possible patterns in CS are largely under innately based controls. These constraints are presented here in a model of intrasentential CS, and their validity is tested against findings of CS practices in a number of communities; all options can be accounted for under the model. Thus the options for CS structures seem universally set; but community-specific or group-specific social forces may determine which permissible patterns are preferred.

As we explored the literature regarding trust in science and scientists we discovered that no instruments were available to assess the construct, and therefore, we developed one. Using a process of data collection from science faculty members and undergraduate students, field testing, expert feedback, and an iterative process of design, we developed, validated, and established the reliability of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory.

Findings from three studies show the following: (1) identification with the group of “gamers” (i.e., people who play video games on a regular basis) influences the extent to which perceivers devalue research suggesting that playing violent video games has negative consequences; (2) this effect is mediated by the feeling that the group of gamers is being stigmatized by such research (Studies 1 and 2) as well as by anger about this research (Study 2); (3) the effect of in-group identification on negative research evaluations cannot be explained by attitude or behavioral preference inconsistency (Studies 1 and 3); and (4) strongly identified gamers not only devalue a specific scientific study but also generalize their negative evaluations to the entire field of violent video games research (Study 3). The findings suggest that the influence of social identity processes on the evaluation of research is larger than it has previously been recognized.

Three studies examined whether potentially threatening scientific findings motivate group members to take action against the respective findings by publicly discrediting them on the Web. Results show that strongly (vs. weakly) identified group members (i.e., people who identified as “gamers”) were particularly likely to discredit social identity threatening findings publicly (i.e., studies that found an effect of playing violent video games on aggression). A content analytical evaluation of online comments revealed that social identification specifically predicted critiques of the methodology employed in potentially threatening, but not in non-threatening research (Study 2). Furthermore, when participants were collectively (vs. self-) affirmed, identification did no longer predict discrediting posting behavior (Study 3). These findings contribute to the understanding of the formation of online collective action and add to the burgeoning literature on the question why certain scientific findings sometimes face a broad public opposition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Nauroth","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Gollwitzer","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Rothmund","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"naurothSocialIdentityThreat2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0117476","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"e0117476","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Social Identity Threat Motivates Science-Discrediting Online Comments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117476","volume":"10"},

We tested social perception as formulated by Stereotype Content Model as one such mediating mechanism. High- and low-status roles from three social contexts varying in solidarity were presented to participants who expressed their perception of the roles’ warmth and competence, as well as moral prescriptions/proscriptions regarding them as both actor and target of acts. Perceived warmth mediated the relationship between solidarity and role-as-actor Fairness, Sanctity, and Liberty, and role-as-target Care and Sanctity, whereas competence mediated the link between perceived status and role-as-target Care and Fairness. Moreover, the interaction of warmth and competence predicted role-as-actor Authority and role-as-target Liberty. Overall, we found evidence for the role-dependency of moral norms, partially explained through perception of the social roles, thereby involving the underlying motive of protecting ingroups’ and reference groups’ position as suggested by SCM. However, given a number of unmediated links, other motives are also suspected to be involved, which remain to be explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Nejat","given":"Pegah"},{"family":"Bagherian","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Hatami","given":"Javad"}],"citation-key":"nejatPerceptionsWarmthCompetence2020","container-title":"Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy","DOI":"10/gjtbzb","ISSN":"1530-2415","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","page":"613-637","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Do Perceptions of Warmth and Competence Explain Moral Norms Regarding Different Social Roles?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/asap.12217","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"nelsonMissedOpportunitiesDialogue2006","abstract":"In the Middle Ages, studies of the natural world, human behavior and theology were part of an interwoven body of knowledge. However, in modern times an increasing divide has separated science and religion. A careful review suggests that currents and accidents in intellectual and social history have served to unnecessarily foreclose lines of thought that might lead to rapprochement of religion with science, including psychology. Developments in Western views of epistemology and the philosophy of science have been a major factor in this estrangement. In the early modern period, flexible views of science (e.g. Bacon) were replaced by doctrinaire formulations emphasizing quantitative methodologies. Especially important was the development of positivism, which opened the door to a reductionistic naturalism that intended not only to reduce dialogue with religion but also to replace it with science. Within psychology, Freud and other early psychologists were eager to establish psychology as a ?real? science and enthusiastically embraced the positivist perspective and rejected possible alternatives. Although this positivist approach is philosophically untenable, it continues to dominate psychology and obstruct dialogue between science and religion as well as progress in psychology as a whole. A return to a broader and more modest conception of science is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nelson","given":"James M."}],"citation-key":"nelsonMissedOpportunitiesDialogue2006","container-title":"Journal of Psychology and Theology","DOI":"10.1177/009164710603400303","ISSN":"0091-6471","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"205-216","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Missed Opportunities in Dialogue between Psychology and Religion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/009164710603400303","volume":"34"},

Such a definition raises a false negative problem, as it does not capture conspiracy theories that are not about events. It also raises a false positive problem because it categorises any conspiracy-based explanation as a conspiracy theory, even though distinguishing conspiracy theories from other conspiracy claims is at the core of many attempts to define this notion. Based on more elaborated definitions and a conceptual reengineering approach, we propose that conspiracy theories can be defined as claims that the public is being pervasively lied to regarding some aspect(s) of reality, to allow some group(s) to enact a harmful, self-serving agenda. Compared to other definitions, ours has the advantage of not taking a position regarding the truth value of conspiracy theories, making it highly operative for psychological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Nera","given":"Kenzo"},{"family":"Schöpfer","given":"Céline"}],"citation-key":"neraWhatSpecialConspiracy2023","container-title":"Theory & Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/09593543231155891","ISSN":"0959-3543","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"287-305","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What is so special about conspiracy theories?

Yet despite dozens of cultural cognition studies, none have directly examined the role of the news media in facilitating these differential interpretations. To address this gap, drawing on a national survey of US adults administered in 2015, we statistically modeled the cultural cognition process in relation to news choices and media effects on public attitudes about climate change. Individuals possessing strongly held cultural worldviews, our findings show, not only choose news outlets where they expect to find culturally congruent arguments about climate change, but they also selectively process the arguments they encounter.

We evaluate the evidence for both theses in the context of developing and testing a theoretical model of audience response to dissonant science communication. Conducting a national online experiment (N = 1,500), we examined audience reactions to both conservative-dissonant and liberal-dissonant science messages and consequences for trust in the scientific community.

  {"id":"norenzayanCulturalEvolutionProsocial2016","abstract":"We develop a cultural evolutionary theory of the origins of prosocial religions and apply it to resolve two puzzles in human psychology and cultural history: (1) the rise of large-scale cooperation among strangers and, simultaneously, (2) the spread of prosocial religions in the last 10–12 millennia. We argue that these two developments were importantly linked and mutually energizing. We explain how a package of culturally evolved religious beliefs and practices characterized by increasingly potent, moralizing, supernatural agents, credible displays of faith, and other psychologically active elements conducive to social solidarity promoted high fertility rates and large-scale cooperation with co-religionists, often contributing to success in intergroup competition and conflict. In turn, prosocial religious beliefs and practices spread and aggregated as these successful groups expanded, or were copied by less successful groups. This synthesis is grounded in the idea that although religious beliefs and practices originally arose as nonadaptive by-products of innate cognitive functions, particular cultural variants were then selected for their prosocial effects in a long-term, cultural evolutionary process. This framework (1) reconciles key aspects of the adaptationist and by-product approaches to the origins of religion, (2) explains a variety of empirical observations that have not received adequate attention, and (3) generates novel predictions. Converging lines of evidence drawn from diverse disciplines provide empirical support while at the same time encouraging new research directions and opening up new questions for exploration and debate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"},{"family":"Shariff","given":"Azim F."},{"family":"Gervais","given":"Will M."},{"family":"Willard","given":"Aiyana K."},{"family":"McNamara","given":"Rita A."},{"family":"Slingerland","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Henrich","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"norenzayanCulturalEvolutionProsocial2016","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X14001356","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"en","page":"e1","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The cultural evolution of prosocial religions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/cultural-evolution-of-prosocial-religions/01B053B0294890F8CFACFB808FE2A0EF","volume":"39"},

However, there is little research on the extent to which public preferences for scientific and religious understandings relate to public opinion about these and other controversies. The authors analyze how perspectives on science and religion map onto public attitudes about a wide range of social, political, and economic issues. Using General Social Survey data, the authors find that individuals oriented toward either science or religion hold differing attitudes in nearly every domain investigated. However, individuals whose worldviews incorporate both science and religion stand apart in surprising ways, which suggests that this third perspective is not located on a conventional liberal-conservative spectrum. Previous research has identified religious-scientific perspectives as a basis for polarization about issues that intersect science and religion, but the authors find that the conflict is far more widespread.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Noy","given":"Shiri"},{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Timothy L."}],"citation-key":"noyNationDividedScience2016","container-title":"Socius","container-title-short":"Socius","DOI":"10.1177/2378023116651876","ISSN":"2378-0231","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2378023116651876","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"A Nation Divided: Science, Religion, and Public Opinion in the United States","title-short":"A Nation Divided","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023116651876","volume":"2"},

The study was a randomized experiment, where college undergraduates (n = 88) discussed, in pairs over the Web, several physics problems related to gravity and air resistance. Prior to their discussions, one‐half of the dyads received information on the nature of scientific arguments. All students were classified epistemologically as relativists, multiplists, or evaluativists. We found that students in the treatment group incorporated more scientific criteria into their discussion notes and accordingly developed better arguments on several dimensions. In addition, significantly more participants in the treatment group adopted the correct answer to one of the problems. Outcomes also differed in relation to students’ epistemic beliefs. Specifically, multiplists were less critical of inconsistencies and misconceptions, and interacted with their partners less than other belief groups, whereas evaluativists interacted more critically, bringing up different ideas from their partners. Evaluativists also solved one of the physics problems more accurately and tended to demonstrate a reduction in misconceptions. We discuss the results in light of instruction in scientific argumentation, conceptual development and change, and epistemic beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Nussbaum","given":"E.

Second, reminding participants of the value of critical evaluation reduces belief in false claims, whereas reminders of the value of trusting science do not.

Latent class analysis reveals three groups based on knowledge and attitudes about science, religiosity, and preferences for certain religious interpretations of the world. The traditional perspective (43 percent) is marked by a preference for religion compared to science; the modern perspective (36 percent) holds the opposite view. A third perspective, which we call post-secular (21 percent), views both science and religion favorably. However, when faced with competing accounts of events such as creation and evolution, post-seculars root their views in religion rather than in mainstream science. Regression models indicate that perspectives on science and religion do not simply mirror other denominational or ideological differences. Furthermore, religio-scientific perspectives shape attitudes about political issues where scientific and some religious communities diverge, including on abortion rights and stem cell research. Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. This suggests that public divisions related to science and religion are cultural and epistemological.

  {"id":"oktarDecidingBeAuthentic2022","abstract":"Deliberative analysis enables us to weigh features, simulate futures, and arrive at good, tractable decisions. So why do we so often eschew deliberation, and instead rely on more intuitive, gut responses? We propose that intuition might be prescribed for some decisions because people's folk theory of decision-making accords a special role to authenticity, which is associated with intuitive choice. Five pre-registered experiments find evidence in favor of this claim. In Experiment 1 (N = 654), we show that participants prescribe intuition and deliberation as a basis for decisions differentially across domains, and that these prescriptions predict reported choice. In Experiment 2 (N = 555), we find that choosing intuitively vs. deliberately leads to different inferences concerning the decision-maker's commitment and authenticity—with only inferences about the decision-maker's authenticity showing variation across domains that matches that observed for the prescription of intuition in Experiment 1.

  {"id":"oktarHowBeliefsPersist","abstract":"On controversial issues from abortion to vaccination, we frequently know that millions disagree with us, yet remain firmly rooted in our beliefs. What enables this capacity to sustain controversial beliefs? To answer this question, we connect insights across the social sciences to develop the Paths to Persistence Model (PPM). The PPM outlines four causes of persistence: People may perceive disagreeing others as ignorant, biased, or stupid (informational), consider the issue to be subjective or unknowable (ontological), expect changing their beliefs to have bad social or personal consequences (functional), or lack the cognitive resources to update their beliefs (computational). We explain how the PPM integrates previous theories across disciplines into interacting ‘paths’ that jointly explain persistence. We then present a pre-registered study with a sample quota-matched to the U.S census on race and sex (N = 1,250) investigating responses to societal disagreement on 96 issues spanning science, politics, morality, and religion. We find that most participants persist in their beliefs amid controversy—even when they learn that they vastly underestimated the extent of societal dissent. Moreover, we find that the paths jointly predict whether people persist, and that the paths are associated with important social outcomes, such as people’s willingness to befriend disagreeing others. Four additional pre-registered open- and close-ended studies support these findings (total other N = 1,921) and our theoretical model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Oktar","given":"Kerem"},{"family":"Lombrozo","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"oktarHowBeliefsPersist","language":"en-us","publisher":"OSF","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"How Beliefs Persist Amid Controversy: The Paths to Persistence Model","title-short":"How Beliefs Persist Amid Controversy","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/9t6va"},
  {"id":"oliveiraAcceptanceEvolutionHigh2022","abstract":"The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of science. Although the strength of the association between evolution acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality, religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic students showed significant differences between the two countries, and the gap between them was wider than between Catholics and non-Catholic Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better understanding of attitudes towards evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Graciela da Silva"},{"family":"Pellegrini","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Araújo","given":"Leonardo Augusto Luvison"},{"family":"Bizzo","given":"Nelio"}],"citation-key":"oliveiraAcceptanceEvolutionHigh2022","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0273929","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,19]]},"page":"e0273929","PMCID":"PMC9484648","PMID":"36121835","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Acceptance of evolution by high school students: Is religion the key factor?","title-short":"Acceptance of evolution by high school students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484648/","volume":"17"},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort of English-speaking parents of children aged 2 months and born from July 10 through December 10, 2010, who belonged to an integrated health care delivery system based in Seattle and who returned a completed baseline PACV. Parents who completed a follow-up survey 8 weeks later were included in the reliability analysis. Parents who remained continuous members in the delivery system until their child was 19 months old were included in the validity analysis.

Study Design: Cross-sectional survey of parents of 19–35 month old children in a closed model HMO.

Construct validity was assessed by linking parental responses to their child’s immunization record.\nResults: Our response rate was 46% (N = 230). Factor analysis identiﬁed 3 factors that explained 70% of the total variance for the 18 survey items. We deleted 3 items that failed to load highly (>.4) on an identiﬁed factor, correlated poorly with other items, or had a hesitant response that was not associated with increased under-immunization.

  {"id":"orlandiRoleReligiosityProduct2022","abstract":"Previous research on religion and economic phenomena has suggested that religious attitudes are related to risk aversion. Moreover, risk attitudes play a significant role in the adoption and diffusion of technological innovations. However, the role of religiosity in technology-related phenomena is still relatively unexplored. The present study fills this gap and investigates the impact of religiosity on the acceptance of innovative technologies and products in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we frame COVID-19 vaccines as new products based on innovative production technologies and show that their acceptance by the general public is negatively associated with country-level religiosity. Furthermore, we investigate the role of religious leaders in endorsing COVID-19 vaccines to their followers. Our hypotheses are empirically tested on 1179 weekly observations of vaccination rates in 22 European countries characterised by different levels of religiosity. The results suggest that religiosity is negatively associated with vaccine rates after controlling for country-level social and economic factors. Conversely, the countries where Roman Catholics are the majority religious group display a positive association between religiosity and vaccine rates, highlighting the role of leaders in endorsing the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Orlandi","given":"Ludovico Bullini"},{"family":"Febo","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Perdichizzi","given":"Salvatore"}],"citation-key":"orlandiRoleReligiosityProduct2022","container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technol Forecast Soc Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2022.122032","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,12]]},"page":"122032","PMCID":"PMC9464621","PMID":"36117496","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The role of religiosity in product and technology acceptance: Evidence from COVID-19 vaccines","title-short":"The role of religiosity in product and technology acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9464621/"},

  {"id":"oseiHepatitisKnowledgeTesting2019","abstract":"Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. The risk of acquiring the infection through exposure to blood, semen, and other bodily fluids is highest among health care workers (HCW) including trainees. Ghana is considered a high risk country for HBV; however little is known about the knowledge and prevention practices of the infection in the country. This study assessed the knowledge, testing, and vaccination history of HBV and their related factors among undergraduate public health students of University of Health and Allied Sciences in Ghana. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 226 students using a pretested questionnaire to assess Hepatitis B knowledge, testing, and vaccination history of the students. We performed logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between Hepatitis B testing and vaccination history and participants’ characteristics. Data was analysed using Stata Version 12. Results. Majority 169 (73.9%) of the 226 participants studied had moderate knowledge regarding HBV infection. About half 114 (50.4%) of them had never been tested for HBV infection, and 100 (44.2%) had received at least a single dose of Hepatitis B vaccine. The completed vaccination rate among the students was 30.5%. Students in their 2nd year (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 3.13; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.13, 7.52; p<0.011) and those with moderate (AOR: 4.76; 95% CI; 1.35, 16.82; P=0.015) and good (AOR: 5.40; 95% CI: 1.31, 22.36; P=0.020) level of knowledge were more likely to be tested for HBV. With regard to vaccination, females (AOR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.04-3.29; P=0.037) and regular students (AOR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.19, 0.70; p=0.002) were associated with receiving the full dose of Hepatitis B vaccine. Conclusion. This study highlights the urgent need for continued health education on HBV infection and strategies that ensure that health trainees are screened and fully vaccinated against the infection to prevent potential future exposure to the virus.

In comparison with no vaccination, we modelled the costs – expressed in 2010 United States dollars (US$) – of averted treatment, transportation costs, productivity losses of caregivers and productivity losses due to disability and death. We used the value-of-a-life-year method to estimate the broader economic and social value of living longer, in better health, as a result of immunization. Findings We estimated that, in the 73 countries, vaccinations given between 2001 and 2020 will avert over 20 million deaths and save US$ 350 billion in cost of illness. The deaths and disability prevented by vaccinations given during the two decades will result in estimated lifelong productivity gains totalling US$ 330 billion and US$ 9 billion, respectively. Over the lifetimes of the vaccinated cohorts, the same vaccinations will save an estimated US$ 5 billion in treatment costs. The broader economic and social value of these vaccinations is estimated at US$ 820 billion.\nConclusion By preventing significant costs and potentially increasing economic productivity among some of the world’s poorest countries, the impact of immunization goes well beyond health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ozawa","given":"Sachiko"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Portnoy","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Grewal","given":"Simrun"},{"family":"Stack","given":"Meghan L"},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Anushua"},{"family":"Mirelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Friberg","given":"Ingrid K"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Neff"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Suraratdecha","given":"Chutima"},{"family":"Sweet","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Goldie","given":"Sue J"},{"family":"Garske","given":"Tini"},{"family":"Li","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Peter M"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Hope L"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Damian"}],"citation-key":"ozawaEstimatedEconomicImpact2017","container-title":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","container-title-short":"Bull.

The interactions between theology and science are complex, and often highly contextual in nature. This makes simple typologies of their interaction rather dubious. There are some similarities between religion and science, including the difficulty of defining them. Concerns about the use and meaning of language, and issues of realism and anti-realism, are found in both areas of thought. Epistemology is important to both areas, and there is increasing acceptance of differing epistemologies not only in religion and science, but also within the various scientific disciplines. One central issue is the question of legitimate influence between science and theology given their aims and methods. Another issue surrounds the question of naturalism in natural science.

  {"id":"paivaScienceReligionDialogueEducation2022","abstract":"This paper examines the relationship between science and religion in the education system of Roman-Catholic Portuguese society. In particular, we explored perceptions of the relationship between science and religion for religious education teachers. We surveyed 198 Portuguese religious education teachers about how they view science and religion. The questionnaires’ results revealed a number of similarities: religious education teachers are highly involved in religious practices and exposed to science; they perceived a compatibility between science and religion; and they have an openness to dialogue between both. They do not adhere to anti-scientific perspectives, but they simultaneously try to limit what can be explained by science. Thus, an interpretative view of dialogue and/or integration seems to best explain the perceptions of religious education teachers of the relationship between science and religion. These findings allow a space of discussion, enabling teachers to possibly foster the science-religion dialogue in their contexts of pedagogical activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Paiva","given":"João Carlos"},{"family":"Rosa","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"João Ricardo"},{"family":"Morais","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Luciano"}],"citation-key":"paivaScienceReligionDialogueEducation2022","container-title":"Research in Science Education","container-title-short":"Res Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11165-020-09941-x","ISSN":"1573-1898","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"287-304","source":"Springer Link","title":"Science-Religion Dialogue in Education: Religion Teachers’ Perceptions in a Roman-Catholic Context","title-short":"Science-Religion Dialogue in Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11165-020-09941-x","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"pardoCognitiveDimensionPublic2004","abstract":"The cognitive dimension of public perceptions of science is a central component of the interdisciplinary field devoted to their study. The subset of this dimension that has received the most attention is the one known as scientific literacy (SL), and particularly scientific knowledge of the “know-what” type. People’s appropriation of scientific theories of the world and also of the inner workings of scientific practice is of interest in itself and also for its role in explaining—in interaction with other variables—public attitudes toward science. Despite its significance, the understanding of science has received progressively less attention since the late 1990s. This paper reviews the substantive characteristics and formal properties of the scale of SL most widely used in the literature, which has been constructed on the basis of Eurobarometer measurements. It considers a number of steps, such as content, item analysis, and differential reliability, both for the total sample and for different nations and social groups, that are usually omitted in the literature. This new analysis shows that the standard SL test barely achieves satisfactory metric properties and that although it captures major (but not fine-grained) differences in SL by nation and sociodemographic groups, it is in need of significant theoretical and formal improvements. Our analysis also shows that a well-known thesis in the literature, the so-called “knowledge-ignorance paradox,” rests on a statistical misinterpretation of the data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Pardo","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Calvo","given":"Félix"}],"citation-key":"pardoCognitiveDimensionPublic2004","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662504045002","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"203-227","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Cognitive Dimension of Public Perceptions of Science: Methodological Issues","title-short":"The Cognitive Dimension of Public Perceptions of Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662504045002","volume":"13"},

Contrary to hypotheses, scientific beliefs were not generally associated with a healthier lifestyle at the between-subject level, and higher reliance on both religion and science predicted more daily comfort food consumption. However, both belief systems buffered negative impacts of daily stress on physical activity at between-person (science) and within-person (religion) levels.

Yet, increasing evidence suggests that motivated reasoning, rather than ignorance, may explain many of these incorrect answers. This article uses novel survey measures to assess two processes by which motivated reasoning might lead to incorrect personal beliefs: motivated individuals may fail to identify the presence of a scientific consensus on some issue or they may recognize a consensus while questioning its veracity. Simultaneously looking at perceptions of what most scientists say and personal beliefs, this study reveals that religiosity and partisanship moderate the extent to which Americans identify scientific consensuses and assert beliefs that contradict their perceptions of consensus. Although these pathways predict the scope of disagreement with science for each of 11 issues, the relative prevalence of each process depends on both the scientific issue and motivational pathway under examination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasek","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"pasekItsNotMy2018","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662517733681","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"787-806","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"It’s not my consensus: Motivated reasoning and the sources of scientific illiteracy","title-short":"It’s not my consensus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662517733681","volume":"27"},

Two-hundred and eighteen high school students in 43 science classes participated in a diary study in which students provided reports of their classroom experiences after each class session for a six-week instructional unit. Multilevel modeling results suggested that interest during science class and behavioral engagement declined over the course of the unit. Daily and cumulative interest during science class predicted behavioral engagement (working hard, participating, and paying attention), cognitive engagement, and agentic engagement. Students’ interest during science class also predicted perceptions that teachers engaged in the motivationally supportive practice of emphasizing student choice during the same and the following class day. Results suggested that the links between interest with working hard and perceptions of choice provision were stronger early in the instructional unit compared to later in the unit. Moreover, some variation was found in these relations depending on students’ gender and ethnicity, as well as depending on the course content and level.

We explore the role of virtues as well as vices in scientific inquiry and their beneficial effects in the context of theory choice. We argue that vices can play a role in widening the set of potential candidate theories and support our claim with historical examples and normative arguments from formal social epistemology.

Overall, children were less likely to judge that religious and magical stories could really happen than unusual and realistic stories although religious children were more likely than secular children to judge that religious stories could really happen. Irrespective of background, children frequently invoked causal regularities in justifying their judgments. Thus, in justifying their conclusion that a story could really happen, children often invoked a causal regularity, whereas in justifying their conclusion that a story could not really happen, they often pointed to the violation of causal regularity. Overall, the findings show that children appraise the likelihood of story events actually happening in light of their beliefs about causal regularities.

  {"id":"paz-y-mino-cEvolutionControversyPhenomenon2015","abstract":"The incompatibility between science and the belief in supernatural causation helps us understand why people do not accept evolution. Belief disrupts, distorts, delays, or stops (3Ds + S) the acceptance of scientific evidence. Here we examine the evolution controversy under three predictions of the incompatibility hypothesis. First, chronological-conflict-and-accommodation, which explains the historical re-emergence of antagonism between evolution and religion when advances in science continue to threaten the belief in supernatural causation; in such situations, creationists’ rejection of and subsequent partial acceptance of the new scientific discoveries are expected. Second, change in evolution's acceptance as function of educational attainment, which explains the positive association between acceptance of evolution and level of education. And third, change in evolution's acceptance as function of religiosity, which explains the negative association between acceptance of evolution and level of religious beliefs. We rely on an ample assessment of the attitudes toward evolution by highly-educated audiences (i.e. research faculty, educators of prospective teachers, and college students in the United States) to characterize the associations among the understanding of science and evolution, personal religious convictions, and conservative ideology. We emphasize that harmonious coexistence between science and religion is illusory. If co-persisting in society, their relationship will fluctuate from moderate to intense antagonism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Paz-y-Miño-C","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Espinosa","given":"Avelina"}],"citation-key":"paz-y-mino-cEvolutionControversyPhenomenon2015","container-title":"The international journal of science in society","container-title-short":"Int J Sci Soc","ISSN":"1836-6236","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"page":"1-23","PMCID":"PMC4751890","PMID":"26877774","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Evolution Controversy: A Phenomenon Prompted by the Incompatibility between Science and Religious Beliefs","title-short":"Evolution Controversy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4751890/","volume":"7"},

We know less about teaching and learning related to wider issues pertinent to both religion and science. In our research with 40 students in six secondary schools in England, we looked at wider issues of student perceptions of religion and science. Our study involved an intervention of six lessons in Science and six in Religious Education (RE). Issues of philosophy, including ethics, were raised in Science lessons. The RE lessons dealt with a variety of contexts that highlighted the question of the relationship(s) between religion and science. In both pre- and post-intervention interviews, we found many instances where students used language that conveyed a misconception of the epistemic distinctions between religion and science. Students referred to ‘truth’, ‘theory’ and ‘facts’ interchangeably when discussing religious and scientific knowledge. We argue that RE needs to attend to epistemic literacy if we are to both avoid epistemological misconceptions and enable students to develop insights into the specific knowledge forms manifested in religion(s).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Jo"},{"family":"Stones","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Reiss","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Mujtaba","given":"Tamjid"}],"citation-key":"pearceSciencePurelyTruth2021","container-title":"British Journal of Religious Education","DOI":"10.1080/01416200.2019.1635434","ISSN":"0141-6200","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,3]]},"page":"174-189","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"‘Science is purely about the truth so I don’t think you could compare it to non-truth versus the truth.’ Students’ perceptions of religion and science, and the relationship(s) between them: religious education and the need for epistemic literacy.","title-short":"‘Science is purely about the truth so I don’t think you could compare it to non-truth versus the truth.’ Students’ perceptions of religion and science, and the relationship(s) between them","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01416200.2019.1635434","volume":"43"},

They assert that science can answer all questions, that there are no limits to science, or that only science provides reliable knowledge, either in a particular realm, such as morality, or about any subject matter whatsoever. This view is often referred to as ‘scientism’. But what exactly is scientism? What is to be said in favour of it and against it? This paper suggests, after a careful evaluation of the arguments for and against scientism, that a helpful way to think of scientism is as of a variety of fundamentalism. It turns out that scientism meets nearly all conditions formulated in family resemblance accounts of fundamentalism. Finally, it is suggested that science and scientists can learn much from religion when it comes to how to deal with scientific fundamentalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Peels","given":"Rik"}],"citation-key":"peelsScientismScientificFundamentalism2023","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1080/03080188.2022.2152246","ISSN":"0308-0188","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"395-410","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Scientism and scientific fundamentalism: what science can learn from mainstream religion","title-short":"Scientism and scientific fundamentalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03080188.2022.2152246","volume":"48"},

Creationist attacks on science education have been evolving in the last few years through the alliance of different varieties. Instead of calls to teach “creation science,” one now finds lobbying for “intelligent design” (ID). Guided by the Discovery Institute's “Wedge strategy,” the ID movement aims to overturn evolution and what it sees as a pernicious materialist worldview and to renew a theistic foundation to Western culture, in which human beings are recognized as being created in the image of God. Common ID arguments involving scientific naturalism, “irreducible complexity,” “complex specified information,” and “icons of evolution,” have been thoroughly examined and refuted. Nevertheless, from Kansas to Ohio to the U.S. Congress, ID continues lobbying to teach the controversy, and scientists need to be ready to defend good evolution education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennock","given":"Robert T."}],"citation-key":"pennockCreationismIntelligentDesign2003","container-title":"Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics","container-title-short":"Annu.

We assess the hypothesis that an analytic cognitive style is associated with a history of questioning, altering, and rejecting (i.e., unbelieving) supernatural claims, both religious and paranormal. In two studies, we examined associations of God beliefs, religious engagement (attendance at religious services, praying, etc.), conventional religious beliefs (heaven, miracles, etc.) and paranormal beliefs (extrasensory perception, levitation, etc.) with performance measures of cognitive ability and analytic cognitive style. An analytic cognitive style negatively predicted both religious and paranormal beliefs when controlling for cognitive ability as well as religious engagement, sex, age, political ideology, and education. Participants more willing to engage in analytic reasoning were less likely to endorse supernatural beliefs. Further, an association between analytic cognitive style and religious engagement was mediated by religious beliefs, suggesting that an analytic cognitive style negatively affects religious engagement via lower acceptance of conventional religious beliefs. Results for types of God belief indicate that the association between an analytic cognitive style and God beliefs is more nuanced than mere acceptance and rejection, but also includes adopting less conventional God beliefs, such as Pantheism or Deism. Our data are consistent with the idea that two people who share the same cognitive ability, education, political ideology, sex, age and level of religious engagement can acquire very different sets of beliefs about the world if they differ in their propensity to think analytically.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Cheyne","given":"James Allan"},{"family":"Seli","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Koehler","given":"Derek J."},{"family":"Fugelsang","given":"Jonathan A."}],"citation-key":"pennycookAnalyticCognitiveStyle2012","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.003","event-place":"Amsterdam","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"12","page":"335-346","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analytic cognitive style predicts religious and paranormal belief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027712000534","volume":"123"},

Recently, however, it has been argued that analytic thinkers are not actually less religious; rather, the putative association may be a result of religiosity typically being measured after analytic thinking (an order effect). In light of this possibility, we report four studies in which a negative correlation between religious belief and performance on analytic thinking measures is found when religious belief is measured in a separate session. We also performed a meta-analysis on all previously published studies on the topic along with our four new studies (N = 15,078, k = 31), focusing specifically on the association between performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (the most widely used individual difference measure of analytic thinking) and religious belief. This meta-analysis revealed an overall negative correlation (r) of -.18, 95% CI [-.21, -.16]. Although this correlation is modest, self-identified atheists (N = 133) scored 18.7% higher than religiously affiliated individuals (N = 597) on a composite measure of analytic thinking administered across our four new studies (d = .72). Our results indicate that the association between analytic thinking and religious disbelief is not caused by a simple order effect.

While recent studies have reported a negative association between an analytic cognitive style and religiosity, they focused exclusively on accuracy, making it difficult to specify potential underlying cognitive mechanisms. The present study extends the previous research by assessing both performance and response times on quintessential logical reasoning problems (syllogisms). Those reporting more religious skepticism made fewer reasoning errors than did believers. This finding remained significant after controlling for general cognitive ability, time spent on the problems, and various demographic variables. Crucial for the purpose of exploring underlying mechanisms, response times indicated that skeptics also spent more time reasoning than did believers. This novel finding suggests a possible role of response slowing during analytic problem solving as a component of cognitive style that promotes overriding intuitive first impressions.

Participants indicated the extent to which they think beliefs (Study 1) or opinions (Studies 2 and 3) ought to change according to evidence on an 8-item scale. Across three studies with 1,692 participants from two different sources (Mechanical Turk and Lucid for Academics), we find that our short AOT-E scale correlates negatively with beliefs about topics ranging from extrasensory perception, to respect for tradition, to abortion, to God; and positively with topics ranging from anthropogenic global warming to support for free speech on college campuses. More broadly, the belief that beliefs should change according to evidence was robustly associated with political liberalism, the rejection of traditional moral values, the acceptance of science, and skepticism about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial claims. However, we also find that AOT-E is much more strongly predictive for political liberals (Democrats) than conservatives (Republicans). We conclude that socio-cognitive theories of belief (both specific and general) should take into account people’s beliefs about when and how beliefs should change – that is, meta-beliefs – but that further work is required to understand how meta-beliefs about evidence interact with political ideology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Cheyne","given":"James Allan"},{"family":"Koehler","given":"Derek J."},{"family":"Fugelsang","given":"Jonathan Albert"}],"citation-key":"pennycookBeliefThatBeliefs2019","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/a7k96","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,24]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the belief that beliefs should change according to evidence: Implications for conspiratorial, moral, paranormal, political, religious, and science beliefs","title-short":"On the belief that beliefs should change according to evidence","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/a7k96"},

Here, we propose conflict detection as a mechanism underlying this relation, on the basis of the hypothesis that more-analytic people are less religious, in part, because they are more sensitive to conflicts between immaterial religious beliefs and beliefs about the material world. To examine cognitive conflict sensitivity, we presented problems containing stereotypes that conflicted with base-rate probabilities in a task with no religious content. In three studies, we found evidence that religiosity is negatively related to conflict detection during reasoning. Independent measures of analytic cognitive style also positively predicted conflict detection.

These studies often present participants with news content that varies on relevant dimensions (e.g., true v. false, politically consistent v. inconsistent, etc.) and ask participants to make judgments (e.g., accuracy) or choices (e.g., whether they would share it on social media). This guide is intended to help researchers navigate the unique challenges that come with this type of research. Principle among these issues is that the nature of news content that is being spread on social media (whether it is false, misleading, or true) is a moving target that reflects current affairs in the context of interest. Steps are required if one wishes to present stimuli that allow generalization from the study to the real-world phenomenon. Furthermore, the selection of content to include can be highly consequential for the study’s outcome, and researcher biases can easily result in biases in a stimulus set. As such, we advocate for pretesting materials and, to this end, report our own pretest of 225 recent true and false news headlines, both relating to U.S. political issues and the COVID-19 pandemic.

  {"id":"pennycookPriorExposureIncreases","abstract":"The 2016 U.S. presidential election brought considerable attention to the phenomenon of “fake news”: entirely fabricated and often partisan content that is presented as factual. Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this “illusory truth effect” for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader’s political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., “The earth is a perfect square”). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than has been previously assumed.","author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Cannon","given":"Tyrone D"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G"}],"citation-key":"pennycookPriorExposureIncreases","language":"en","page":"28","source":"Zotero","title":"Prior Exposure Increases Perceived Accuracy of Fake News","type":"article-journal"},

To test these competing models, we identified a range of controversial issues subject to potential ideological disagreement and examined the roles of political ideology, science knowledge, and cognitive sophistication on science beliefs. Our results indicate that there was surprisingly little partisan disagreement on a wide range of contentious scientific issues. We also found weak evidence for identity-protective cognition (where cognitive sophistication exacerbates partisan disagreement); instead, cognitive sophistication (i.e., reasoning ability) was generally associated with proscience beliefs. In two studies focusing on anthropogenic climate change, we found that increased political motivations did not increase polarization among individuals who are higher in cognitive sophistication, which indicates that increased political motivations might not have as straightforward an impact on science beliefs as has been assumed in the literature. Finally, our findings indicate that basic science knowledge is the most consistent predictor of people’s beliefs about science across a wide range of issues.

  {"id":"pennycookWhoFallsFake2017","abstract":"Fake news represents a particularly egregious and direct avenue by which inaccurate beliefs have been propagated via social media. Here we investigate the cognitive psychological profile of individuals who fall prey to fake news. We find a consistent positive correlation between the propensity to think analytically – as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) – and the ability to differentiate fake news from real news (“media truth discernment”). This was true regardless of whether the article’s source was indicated (which, surprisingly, also had no main effect on accuracy judgments). Contrary to the motivated reasoning account, CRT was just as positively correlated with media truth discernment, if not more so, for headlines that aligned with individuals’ political ideology relative to those that were politically discordant. The link between analytic thinking and media truth discernment was driven both by a negative correlation between CRT and perceptions of fake news accuracy (particularly among Hillary Clinton supporters), and a positive correlation between CRT and perceptions of real news accuracy (particularly among Donald Trump supporters). This suggests that factors that undermine the legitimacy of traditional news media may exacerbate the problem of inaccurate political beliefs among Trump supporters, who engaged in less analytic thinking and were overall less able to discern fake from real news (regardless of the news’ political valence). We also found consistent evidence that pseudoprofound bullshit receptivity negatively correlates with perceptions of fake news accuracy; a correlation that is mediated by analytic thinking. Finally, analytic thinking was associated with an unwillingness to share both fake and real news on social media.

  {"id":"perryCultureWarsCOVID192020","abstract":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans’ behavioral responses were quickly politicized. Those on the left stressed precautionary behaviors, while those on the (religious) right were more likely to disregard recommended precautions. We propose the far right response was driven less by partisanship or religiosity per se, but rather by an ideology that connects disregard for scientific expertise; a conception of Americans as God's chosen and protected people; distrust for news media; and allegiance to Trump―Christian nationalism. Analyzing panel data collected in the thick of the COVID-19 crisis, we find Christian nationalism was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in incautious behavior like eating in restaurants, visiting family/friends, or gathering with 10+ persons (though not attending church), and was the second strongest predictor that Americans took fewer precautions like wearing a mask or sanitizing/washing one's hands. Religiosity, in contrast, was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in more frequent precautionary behaviors. Findings document that Christian nationalism, not religious commitment per se, undergirded the far-right response to COVID-19 that disregarded precautionary recommendations, thus potentially worsening the pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Samuel L."},{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Andrew L."},{"family":"Grubbs","given":"Joshua B."}],"citation-key":"perryCultureWarsCOVID192020","container-title":"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion","DOI":"10.1111/jssr.12677","ISSN":"1468-5906","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"405-416","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Culture Wars and COVID-19 Conduct: Christian Nationalism, Religiosity, and Americans’ Behavior During the Coronavirus Pandemic","title-short":"Culture Wars and COVID-19 Conduct","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12677","volume":"59"},
  {"id":"perryIgnoranceCultureWar2021","abstract":"Religiously conservative Americans consistently demonstrate lower scientific literacy than other Americans. Some argue, however, that Americans' scientific literacy is contingent on subcultural conflict, showing differences in scientific literacy that emerge only on religiously contested scientific claims. Building on these insights, we find that the most salient factor explaining Americans' divergence on contested (though not on uncontested) scientific claims is not religious commitment or conservatism per se, but an ideology that seeks political-and consequently epistemic-dominance: Christian nationalism. National data show that Christian nationalism is unassociated with Americans' answers on questions about uncontested scientific knowledge. However, Christian nationalism is the strongest predictor of incorrect answers on questions about religiously contested scientific claims. Contemporary \"culture war\" debates over science have little to do with outright ignorance of science, nor are they strictly about religiosity or theological conservatism. Rather, disputes over science and religion reflect politically motivated denials of scientific facts that threaten Christian nationalism's claims to epistemic and cultural authority.","author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Samuel L."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Joseph O."},{"family":"Grubbs","given":"Joshua B."}],"citation-key":"perryIgnoranceCultureWar2021","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science (Bristol, England)","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10/gjwgg9","ISSN":"1361-6609","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"9636625211006271","PMID":"33855921","source":"PubMed","title":"Ignorance or culture war?

Previous research mostly focuses on the thesis that people’s partisan identities motivate them to share hostile political rumors as a way to tarnish their political opponents. In this manuscript, we demonstrate disruptive psychological motivations also play an important, but often overlooked, role in the spread of hostile rumors. We argue that many individuals who feel socially and politically marginalized are motivated to circulate hostile rumors because they wish to unleash chaos to “burn down” the entire established political order in the hope they can gain status in the process. We conducted 8 large studies (including a nationally representative study) to show that some individuals are predisposed to have a Need for Chaos when facing social isolation and discontent, and that this need is the strongest predictor of explicit motivations to share hostile political rumors. Panel and experimental data show that chaotic motivations reflect an interplay between traits related to status-seeking and states of social exclusion. Consistent with the rising inequality in the United States and beyond, we find that these motivations are strikingly prevalent. To stem the tide of hostile political rumors on social media, the present findings suggest that real-world policy solutions are needed to address the growing social and political frustrations of democratic populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Osmundsen","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Arceneaux","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"petersenNeedChaosMotivations2018","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/6m4ts","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The “Need for Chaos” and Motivations to Share Hostile Political Rumors","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/6m4ts"},

Participants were presented a series of immoral actions and were asked to justify the wrongness of the action by appealing to either the violation of a rule (rule-based argument) or the negative consequences resulting from the action (outcome-based argument). In Study 1, it was shown both among British and American samples that religious individuals preferred rule-based moral arguments to consequentialist moral arguments more than nonreligious individuals, and covariance with political conservatism did not account for this effect. Study 2 replicated these results with revisions to the materials and extended measures. In this study, dimensions of religiosity—particularly Christian Orthodoxy—predicted rule-based morality independent of a personal need for structure, need for cognition, and right-wing authoritarianism. These results imply that religious individuals who are committed to orthodox religious teaching display a deontological style of morality for reasons that extend beyond a need for structure, cognitive simplicity, or submission to authority.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Piazza","given":"Jared"}],"citation-key":"piazzaIfYouLove2012","container-title":"The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion","DOI":"10.1080/10508619.2011.638598","ISSN":"1050-8619","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,1]]},"page":"285-302","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"“If You Love Me Keep My Commandments”: Religiosity Increases Preference for Rule-Based Moral Arguments","title-short":"“If You Love Me Keep My Commandments”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10508619.2011.638598","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"piazzaLeanNotYour2013","abstract":"Recent research has shown that religious individuals are much more resistant to utilitarian modes of thinking than their less religious counterparts, but the reason for this is not clear. We propose that a meta-ethical belief that morality is rooted in inviolable divine commands (i.e., endorsement of Divine Command Theory) may help explain this ﬁnding. We present a novel 20-item scale measuring a belief that morality is founded on divine authority. The scale shows good internal reliability and convergent and discriminant validity. Study 1 found that this scale fully mediated the relationship that various religiosity measures had with a deontological thinking style in our sample of American adults. It also accounted for the link between religiosity and social conservative values. Furthermore, the relationship between the scale and these outcome variables held after statistically controlling for variables related to actively open-minded thinking and the Big Five. Study 2 replicated the results using naturalistic moral dilemmas that placed deontological and utilitarian concerns in conﬂict, and showed that the results of Study 1 cannot be explained by differences in moral foundations (e.g., concern for authority more generally) or differences in the perceived function of rules. Quite the contrary, endorsement of the divine origins of morality fully mediated the relationship religiosity had with the so-called “binding” foundations (i.e., Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity).

Study 2 ruled out differences in welfare sensitivity as an explanation for these findings. In Study 3, religiosity and political conservatism predicted a commitment to judging “harmless” taboo violations morally impermissible, rather than discretionary, despite the lack of negative consequences rising from the act. Furthermore, non-consequentialist thinking style was shown to mediate the relationship religiosity/conservatism had with impermissibility judgments, while intuitive thinking style did not.

  {"id":"pierikReligiousSecularExemptions2017","abstract":"This paper analyses exemptions to general law through the prism of vaccine waivers in the United States. All US states legally require the vaccination of children prior to school or daycare entry; however, this obligation is accompanied with a system of medical, religious, and/or philosophical exemptions. Nonmedical exemptions became subject of discussion after the 2015 Disneyland measles outbreak in California, which unequivocally brought to light what had been brewing below the surface for a while: a slow but steady decline in vaccination rates in Western societies, resulting in the reoccurrence of measles outbreaks. This can be traced back to an increasing public questioning of vaccines by a growing anti-vaccination movement. In reaction to the outbreak and the public outrage it generated, several states proposed—and some already passed—bills to eliminate nonmedical exemptions., I analyze two questions. First, can legal exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccination schemes for parents who are opposed to vaccination (still) be justified? Second, should legal exemptions be limited to religious objections to vaccination, or should they also be granted to secular objections? Although the argument in the paper starts from the example of the US, it seeks to provide a more general philosophical reflection on the question of exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Pierik","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"pierikReligiousSecularExemptions2017","container-title":"Ethnicities","container-title-short":"Ethnicities","DOI":"10.1177/1468796817692629","ISSN":"1468-7968","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"220-241","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"On religious and secular exemptions: A case study of childhood vaccination waivers","title-short":"On religious and secular exemptions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1468796817692629","volume":"17"},

The present review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the factors that could influence the coexistence of supernatural and scientific explanatory frameworks regarding the concepts of the origins of life, illness, and death/afterlife. On the basis of 35 identified articles (45 studies) which have been published between 1985 and 2016 and examined both scientific and supernatural explanations within these concepts, the impact of age, religiousness, scientific expertise, cultural background, and contextual factors was explored. Results suggest that although religiousness, cultural background, and contextual information have a large effect on the concepts of death/afterlife, illness, and the origins of life respectively, the magnitude of the average effect depends on the concept.

  {"id":"pollackReligiousIndividualizationSecularization2007","abstract":"The individualization thesis advanced by sociologists of religion such as Grace Davie, Danièle Hervieu–Léger, Michael Krüggeler, Thomas Luckmann, Hubert Knoblauch, Wade Clark Roof, Wayne E. Baker, and others has become increasingly widespread especially in Europe within the sociology of religion. In contrast to the secularization theory it assumes that processes of modernization will not lead to a decline in the social significance of religion, but rather to a change in its social forms. According to the individualization theory, traditional and institutionalized forms of religiosity will be increasingly replaced by more subjective ones detached form church, individually chosen, and syncretistic in character. The article examines the empirical applicability of the individualization thesis on the basis of how religiosity and church affiliation have evolved in Germany over the past 50 years. It comes to the conclusion that the rise of individually determined non-church religiosity cannot compensate for the losses of institutionalized religiosity, since non-church religiosity remains rather marginal and is interwoven with traditional Christian religiosity. Religious individualization is only a component of the predominant secularization process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollack","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"Pickel","given":"Gert"}],"citation-key":"pollackReligiousIndividualizationSecularization2007","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-4446.2007.00168.x","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"603-632","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Religious individualization or secularization?

  {"id":"polzlerMoralProgressKnowledge2022","abstract":"A prevalent assumption in metaethics is that people believe in moral objectivity. If this assumption were true then people should believe in the possibility of objective moral progress, objective moral knowledge, and objective moral error. We developed surveys to investigate whether these predictions hold. Our results suggest that, neither abstractly nor concretely, people dominantly believe in the possibility of objective moral progress, knowledge and error. They attribute less objectivity to these phenomena than in the case of science and no more, or only slightly more, than in the cases of social conventions and personal preferences. This finding was obtained for a regular sample as well as for a sample of people who are particularly likely to be reflective and informed (philosophers and philosophy students). Our paper hence contributes to recent empirical challenges to the thesis that people believe in moral objectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Pölzler","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Zijlstra","given":"Lieuwe"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"polzlerMoralProgressKnowledge2022","container-title":"Philosophical Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/09515089.2022.2119951","ISSN":"0951-5089","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,16]]},"page":"1-37","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Moral progress, knowledge and error: Do people believe in moral objectivity?","title-short":"Moral progress, knowledge and error","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09515089.2022.2119951","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"porotScienceBeliefProgress2021","abstract":"The empirical study of belief is emerging at a rapid clip, uniting work from all corners of cognitive science. Reliance on belief in understanding and predicting behavior is widespread. Examples can be found, inter alia, in the placebo, attribution theory, theory of mind, and comparative psychological literatures. Research on belief also provides evidence for robust generalizations, including about how we fix, store, and change our beliefs. Evidence supports the existence of a Spinozan system of belief fixation: one that is automatic and independent of belief rejection. Independent research supports the existence of a system of fragmented belief storage: one that relies on large numbers of causally isolated, context-sensitive stores of belief in memory. Finally, empirical and observational data support at least two systems of belief change. One system adheres, mostly, to epistemological norms of updating; the other, the psychological immune system, functions to guard our most centrally held beliefs from potential inconsistency with newly formed beliefs. Refining our understanding of these systems can shed light on pressing real-world issues, such as how fake news, propaganda, and brainwashing exploit our psychology of belief, and how best to construct our modern informational world.

The paper argues as its central thesis that religion has major roles to play in enabling the world’s societies and individuals to take the actions necessary to address climate change causes, impacts, and related issues in an effective and ethical manner. The pivotal roles of religion in issues of climate change and environmental justice hinge primarily on religions’ functions in society, ethical teachings, reach and influence, and ability to inspire adherents to action. Religions’ ability to inspire action is evaluated empirically against data from 2 compilations of religious activity on climate change. The analysis indicates significant religiously based involvement and influence on ethical aspects of climate change and point to much greater potential for the role of religion in future solutions to the climate crisis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Posas","given":"P.

We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”.

We argue that a belief's value is determined, at least in part, by its explanatory power. Highly valuable beliefs are those that can uniquely explain and organize a diverse set of observations. Less valuable beliefs, in contrast, are those that can be explained by other observations, or that explain and organize few observations. The results of three experiments are consistent with these hypotheses. These experiments demonstrate that applying either scientific or religious beliefs to explain other observations increases the perceived value of those beliefs, whereas generating explanations for the existence of beliefs decreases their perceived value. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for people's resistance to explaining their own beliefs, for the perceived value of science and religion, and for culture wars between people holding opposing beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Preston","given":"Jesse Lee"},{"family":"Epley","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"prestonExplanationsApplicationsExplanatory2005","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01621.x","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"826-832","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Explanations Versus Applications: The Explanatory Power of Valuable Beliefs","title-short":"Explanations Versus Applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01621.x","volume":"16"},

In Experiment 2, using God as an explanation increased automatic evaluations of God, but decreased automatic evaluations of science.

An open-minded cognitive style is marked by willingness to consider a variety of intellectual perspectives, values, opinions, or beliefs—even those that contradict the individual’s opinion. An individual’s level of cognitive openness is expected to vary across domains (such as politics and religion). Four studies develop and validate a novel measure of openminded cognition, as well as two domain-specific measures of religious and political open-minded cognition. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (controlling for acquiescence bias) are used to develop the scales in Studies 1 to 3. Study 4 demonstrates that these scales possess convergent and discriminant validity. Study 5 demonstrates the scale’s unique predictive validity using the outcome of Empathic Concern (Davis, 1980).

This perception would presumably undermine one's ability to benefit fully from both systems, leading to the research questions examined here: does the perceived incompatibility between religion and science vary cross-culturally, and is this level of incompatibility itself related to group member well-being? Our data set included 55,230 participants from 54 countries, organized for analytical purposes into 13 global regions and 11 belief groups. We found that perceived incompatibility between R/S and pro-science beliefs was indeed characteristic of the West but was not the norm cross-culturally. We also found that higher levels of belief system compatibility related positively to well-being, and especially to the strength of positive associations between well-being and each type of belief system. That is, in regions and belief groups that perceived higher compatibility, well-being's positive relationships with R/S and pro-science beliefs were both also higher. We speculate about compatibility's potential causal effects on these relationships, noting that as compatibility increases, so does the possibility of benefiting from one system without forgoing the benefits of the other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Price","given":"Michael E."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Dominic D.

  {"id":"provencherBetterUnderstandingCognitive2011","abstract":"Despite its intuitive appeal and the empirical evidence for it, the hypothesis of cognitive polyphasia (Moscovici, 1961/1976/2008) remains largely unexplored. This article attempts to clarify some of the ideas behind this concept by examining its operations at the level of individuals and by proposing a conceptual model that includes some elements of social cognition. Indeed, calls for a rapprochement between the theory of social representations and cognitive psychology have been made by Moscovici, in particular, in his 1984 paper on The myth of the lonely paradigm and in his paper on La nouvelle pensée magique (1992) in which he argues that the theory of social representations provides an explanatory framework for the descriptions offered by cognitive psychology and that their combining could translate into a finer understanding of contemporary social phenomena. Building on the results of an empirical examination of the controversy that surrounded the MMR vaccination programme in the UK between 1998 and 2005, different ways of engaging into cognitive polyphasia are proposed, including what can be described as cognitive “monophasia”, that is, the exclusive use of one type of knowledge, at least at the level of the individual. A brief discussion about the implications of the proposed conceptual model for our understanding of cognitive polyphasia and of the different ways of making sense of the world around us concludes this article.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Provencher","given":"Claudine"}],"citation-key":"provencherBetterUnderstandingCognitive2011","container-title":"Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-5914.2011.00468.x","ISSN":"1468-5914","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"377-395","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Towards A Better Understanding of Cognitive Polyphasia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-5914.2011.00468.x","volume":"41"},

We tested these predictions in a quasi-representative survey, an experimental study, and a longitudinal study (total N = 1,213; all studies pre-registered). Indeed, believing in and being confronted with a corona conspiracy decreased institutional trust, support of governmental regulations, adoption of physical distancing, and (to some extend also) social engagement. Findings underscore that conspiracy theories have severe societal effects in the context of COVID-19.","author":[{"family":"Pummerer","given":"Lotte"},{"family":"Böhm","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Lilleholt","given":"Lau"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Zettler","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Sassenberg","given":"Kai"}],"citation-key":"pummererConspiracyTheoriesTheir2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/y5grn","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,24]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Conspiracy theories and their societal effects during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article"},

  {"id":"purzyckiEvolutionReligionMorality2018","abstract":"Understanding the expansion of human sociality and cooperation beyond kith and kin remains an important evolutionary puzzle. There is likely a complex web of processes including institutions, norms, and practices that contributes to this phenomenon. Considerable evidence suggests that one such process involves certain components of religious systems that may have fostered the expansion of human cooperation in a variety of ways, including both certain forms of rituals and commitment to particular types of gods. Using an experimental economic game, our team specifically tested whether or not individually held mental models of moralistic, punishing, and knowledgeable gods curb biases in favor of the self and the local community, and increase impartiality toward geographically distant anonymous co-religionists. Our sample includes 591 participants from eight diverse societies – iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians who practice both Christianity and ancestor worship, the animist Hadza of Tanzania, Hindu Indo-Fijians, Hindu Mauritians, shamanist-Buddhist Tyvans of southern Siberia, traditional Inland and Christian Coastal Vanuatuans from Tanna, and Christian Brazilians from Pesqueiro.

  {"id":"purzyckiMoralizationBiasGods","abstract":"There are compelling reasons to expect that representing any active, powerful god or spirit may contribute to cooperation. One possible mechanism underlying this eﬀect is a system that infers that spiritual agents are morally concerned. If individuals cognitive represent deities as agents, and if agents are generally conceptualized as having moral concern, a broad tendency to attribute moral concern–a “moralization bias”–to supernatural deities follows. Using data from 2,229 individuals in 15 diﬀerent ﬁeld sites, we test for the existence of such a bias. We ﬁnd that people are indeed more likely than not to indicate that supernatural deities are concerned with punishing immoral behavior in the form of theft, murder, and deceit, an eﬀect that is stable even after holding constant the inﬂuence of explicitly moralistic deities. We also ﬁnd that when deities are not associated with morality, communities socially sanction commitment to them. We posit that the moralization bias of gods’ minds is part of a widespread but variable religious phenotype, and a candidate mechanism that contributes to the well-recognized association between religion and social harmony.","author":[{"family":"Purzycki","given":"Benjamin Grant"},{"family":"Willard","given":"Aiyana K"},{"family":"Klocová","given":"Eva Kundtová"},{"family":"Apicella","given":"Coren"},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Bolyanatz","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Handley","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Henrich","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lesorogol","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"McNamara","given":"Rita A"},{"family":"Moya","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"},{"family":"Placek","given":"Caitlyn"},{"family":"Soler","given":"Montserrat"},{"family":"Weigel","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Xygalatas","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Cody T"}],"citation-key":"purzyckiMoralizationBiasGods","language":"en","page":"26","source":"Zotero","title":"The Moralization Bias of Gods' Minds: A Cross-Cultural Test","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"raabThirtyShadesTruth2013","abstract":"Recent studies on conspiracy theories employ standardized questionnaires, thus neglecting their narrative qualities by reducing them to mere statements. Recipients are considered as consumers only. Two empirical studies—a conventional survey (n = 63) and a study using the method of narrative construction (n = 30)—which were recently conducted by the authors of this paper—suggest that the truth about conspiracy theories is more complex. Given a set of statements about a dramatic historic event (in our case 9/11) that includes ofﬁcial testimonies, allegations to a conspiracy and extremely conspiratorial statements, the majority of participants created a narrative of 9/11 they deemed plausible that might be considered a conspiracy theory. The resulting 30 idiosyncratic stories imply that no clear distinction between ofﬁcial story and conspiratorial narrative is possible any more when the common approach of questionnaires is abandoned. Based on these ﬁndings, we present a new theoretical and methodological approach which acknowledges conspiracy theories as a means of constructing and communicating a set of personal values. While broadening the view upon such theories, we stay compatible with other approaches that have focused on extreme theory types. In our view, accepting conspiracy theories as a common, regulative and possibly benign phenomenon, we will be better able to understand why some people cling to immunized, racist and off-wall stories—and others do not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Raab","given":"Marius H."},{"family":"Ortlieb","given":"Stefan A."},{"family":"Auer","given":"Nikolas"},{"family":"Guthmann","given":"Klara"},{"family":"Carbon","given":"Claus-Christian"}],"citation-key":"raabThirtyShadesTruth2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00406","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Thirty shades of truth: conspiracy theories as stories of individuation, not of pathological delusion","title-short":"Thirty shades of truth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00406/abstract","volume":"4"},

Two hundred and thirty-two Brazilian researchers in the field of psychology answered questions related to 10 different QRPs. Brazilian researchers indicated a lower tendency to engage in two QRPs (failing to report all of a study's dependent measures; deciding whether to collect more data after looking to see whether the results were significant) when compared to their Italian and North American counterparts, but indicated a higher tendency to engage in two other QRPs (selectively reporting studies that “worked”; not reporting all of a study's conditions). Most of the sample did not admit integrity conflicts in their own research but indicated that others have integrity problems, as observed in previous studies. Those discrepancies could be attributed to contextual and systemic factors regarding different publication demands among the different nations.

  {"id":"rabinowitzBeliefsChildhoodVaccination2016","abstract":"Several contagious diseases were nearly eradicated through childhood vaccination, but some parents have decided in recent years not to fully vaccinate their children, raising new public health concerns. The question of whether and how beliefs about vaccination are linked to political ideology has been hotly debated. This study investigates the effects of ideology on perceptions of harms and benefits related to vaccination as well as judgments of others’ attitudes. A total of 367 U.S. adults (131 men, 236 women; Mage = 34.92 years, range = 18–72) completed an online survey through Mechanical Turk. Results revealed that liberals were significantly more likely to endorse pro-vaccination statements and to regard them as “facts” (rather than “beliefs”), in comparison with moderates and conservatives. Whereas conservatives overestimated the proportion of like-minded others who agreed with them, liberals underestimated the proportion of others who agreed with them. That is, conservatives exhibited the “truly false consensus effect,” whereas liberals exhibited an “illusion of uniqueness” with respect to beliefs about vaccination. Conservative and moderate parents in this sample were less likely than liberals to report having fully vaccinated their children prior to the age of two. A clear limitation of this study is that the sample is not representative of the U.S. population. Nevertheless, a recognition of ideological sources of potential variability in health-related beliefs and perceptions is a prerequisite for the design of effective forms of public communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Rabinowitz","given":"Mitchell"},{"family":"Latella","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Chadly"},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"rabinowitzBeliefsChildhoodVaccination2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0158382","editor":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Niyaz"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e0158382","source":"Crossref","title":"Beliefs about Childhood Vaccination in the United States: Political Ideology, False Consensus, and the Illusion of Uniqueness","title-short":"Beliefs about Childhood Vaccination in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158382","volume":"11"},

Does cooperation require deliberate self-restraint? Or is spontaneous prosociality reined in by calculating self-interest? Here we present a theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this ‘social heuristics hypothesis’ by aggregating across every cooperation experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period (15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average effect of time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial variation in this effect, and show that this variation is partly explained by previous experience with one-shot lab experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."},{"family":"Peysakhovich","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Kraft-Todd","given":"Gordon T."},{"family":"Newman","given":"George E."},{"family":"Wurzbacher","given":"Owen"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."}],"citation-key":"randSocialHeuristicsShape2014a","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms4677","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,22]]},"language":"en","license":"2014 Springer Nature Limited","page":"3677","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Social heuristics shape intuitive cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4677","volume":"5"},

Here, across four experiments (n = 3,364), we motivated US participants to be accurate by providing financial incentives for correct responses about the veracity of true and false political news headlines. Financial incentives improved accuracy and reduced partisan bias in judgements of headlines by about 30%, primarily by increasing the perceived accuracy of true news from the opposing party (d = 0.47). Incentivizing people to identify news that would be liked by their political allies, however, decreased accuracy. Replicating prior work, conservatives were less accurate at discerning true from false headlines than liberals, yet incentives closed the gap in accuracy between conservatives and liberals by 52%. A non-financial accuracy motivation intervention was also effective, suggesting that motivation-based interventions are scalable.

Using an array of measures of religiosity, results show that cognitive ability has a medium to large negative effect on various aspects of religiosity. Though also negatively related to religiosity, rational thinking style did not add significant unique effects, nor did it convey a significant indirect effect from cognitive ability. Experiential thinking was generally unrelated to ability but was positively related to some aspects of religiosity. Overall the results confirm that those with higher cognitive ability are less likely to accept religious doctrine or engage in religious behaviors and those with lower ability are more likely to accept religious doctrine and exhibit higher levels of fundamentalism.

  {"id":"reifHowRepresentativeSurveys2021","abstract":"Over the past several years, scholars have debated the public’s (dis)trust in science. Since the ‘science and society’ paradigm of science communication has defined the crisis of trust between science and the public as a major concern, this article is interested in how public (dis)trust in science is measured in representative surveys of public perceptions of science and technology. The goal is to systematise survey measures using a theoretical model of (dis)trust in science as a multidimensional variable that is relevant to the relationship between the public, (intermediaries) and science. A systematic review of items and open-ended questions (n = 736) used in 20 representative surveys from various countries was conducted. The results show that surveys rarely measure distrust in science, and instead focus on trust in science – mainly at the macro-level – rather than trust in scientists (micro-level) or scientific organisations (meso-level). Benevolence is the dimension of trust considered most frequently; the media is predominantly included as a general type of contact with science without a direct link to (dis)trust. Hence, representative surveys cover a number of different aspects of public (dis)trust in science. However, there is room for improvement. Thus, this paper concludes with recommendations for future measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Reif","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Guenther","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"reifHowRepresentativeSurveys2021","container-title":"Journal of Trust Research","DOI":"10.1080/21515581.2022.2075373","ISSN":"2151-5581","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,3]]},"page":"94-118","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How representative surveys measure public (dis)trust in science: A systematisation and analysis of survey items and open-ended questions","title-short":"How representative surveys measure public (dis)trust in science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21515581.2022.2075373","volume":"11"},

Despite anecdotal evidence of a spike in discriminatory behavior targeted at Asians across western countries, little empirical evidence for this “othering” hypothesis exists. Using a large survey (n = 4311) benchmarked to national demographics, we analyze the relationship between attitudes toward Asian Americans, xenophobia, concern about contracting the coronavirus, and a variety of behavioral outcomes and policy attitudes. We find evidence that anti-Asian attitudes are associated with concern about the virus but also with xenophobic behaviors and policy preferences. These relationships are unique to Asian American attitudes, are not related to attitudes toward other outgroups, and do not hold for a variety of placebo outcomes. Together our findings suggest that anti-Asian attitudes were activated and were associated with a variety of COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors in the early stages of the pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Reny","given":"Tyler T."},{"family":"Barreto","given":"Matt A."}],"citation-key":"renyXenophobiaTimePandemic2020","container-title":"Politics, Groups, and Identities","DOI":"10.1080/21565503.2020.1769693","ISSN":"2156-5503","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,28]]},"page":"1-24","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Xenophobia in the time of pandemic: othering, anti-Asian attitudes, and COVID-19","title-short":"Xenophobia in the time of pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21565503.2020.1769693","volume":"0"},

Yet, it has not been quantitatively assessed how the perception of scientific uncertainties relates to engagement with science on an individual level. In this article, we report the development and testing of a new questionnaire in English and German measuring the perceived uncertainty of scientific evidence. Results indicate that the scale is reliable and valid in both language versions and that its two subscales are differentially related to measures of engagement: Science-friendly attitudes were positively related only to ?subjectively? perceived uncertainty, whereas interest in science as well as behavioural engagement actions and intentions were largely uncorrelated. We conclude that perceiving scientific knowledge to be uncertain is only weakly, but positively related to engagement with science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Retzbach","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Otto","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Maier","given":"Michaela"}],"citation-key":"retzbachMeasuringPerceivedUncertainty2016","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662515575253","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"638-655","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Measuring the perceived uncertainty of scientific evidence and its relationship to engagement with science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662515575253","volume":"25"},

In the present paper, we provide a two-factor structure for understanding the current state of research on moralization, categorizing extant moralization research by (1) whether it examines judgments of actions, attitudes, or entities and (2) whether it captures moral recognition (the shift from neutral to moral), or moral amplification. Using this framework, we then consider the various routes through which moralization may occur, discuss emerging research on the influence that social norms can have on this process, and address future areas of research. Overall, we hope to provide some initial steps toward developing a more integrated framework for understanding moralization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rhee","given":"Joshua J."},{"family":"Schein","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Bastian","given":"Brock"}],"citation-key":"rheeWhatHowWhy2019","container-title":"Social and Personality Psychology Compass","DOI":"10.1111/spc3.12511","ISSN":"1751-9004","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"e12511","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The what, how, and why of moralization: A review of current definitions, methods, and evidence in moralization research","title-short":"The what, how, and why of moralization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12511","volume":"13"},

Results indicated that a belief that scientific knowledge develops and that justification is necessary to valid knowledge in science were positively related to mastery goals, task value, and self-efficacy. Epistemic beliefs were also found to predict science grades over and above the contributions of motivational factors. Surprisingly, an uncritical acceptance of authority figures and a belief in scientific knowledge as certain were more typical of students who adopted motivational states (e.g., mastery goals) previously found to be supportive of learning.

Before scientism can be evaluated, it needs to be clear what it is. Hence, the collection opens with essays that provide an overview of the many different versions of scientism and their mutual interrelations. Next, several card-carrying proponents of scientism make their case, either by developing and arguing directly for their preferred version of scientism or by responding to objections. Then, the floor is given to critics of scientism. It is examined whether scientism is epistemically vicious, whether scientism presents a plausible general epistemological outlook and whether science has limits. The final four essays zoom out and connect scientism to ongoing debates elsewhere in philosophy. What does scientism mean for religious epistemology? What can science tell us about morality and is a scientistic moral epistemology plausible? How is scientism related to physicalism?

  {"id":"rigoliComputationalPerspectiveFaith2021","abstract":"Religious reasoning (the processes through which religious beliefs are formed) has been investigated by two different approaches. First, explanation theories portray religious reasoning as arising for explaining salient aspects of reality. Second, motivation theories interpret religious reasoning as driven by other motives, for example fostering community bonding. Both approaches have provided fundamental insight, yet whether they can be reconciled remains unclear. To address this, I propose a unifying computational theory of religious reasoning expressed in mathematical terms. Although a mathematical approach has been rarely applied to study religion, its advantage is describing a phenomenon clearly and formally. Relying on a Bayesian decision framework, the model comprises three key elements: prior beliefs, novel evidence, and utility. The first two describe the processes classically interpreted by explanation theories, while utility captures phenomena highlighted by motivation theories. By reconciling explanation and motivation theories, this proposal offers a unifying computational picture of religious reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rigoli","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"rigoliComputationalPerspectiveFaith2021","container-title":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","container-title-short":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/2153599X.2020.1812704","ISSN":"2153-599X, 2153-5981","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"147-164","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A computational perspective on faith: religious reasoning and Bayesian decision","title-short":"A computational perspective on faith","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2020.1812704","volume":"11"},

We propose that religious ideas represent an attempt to explain away residuals, that is, to explain discrepancies between observations and predictions. The framework postulates probabilistic generative models where gods are described by latent variables whose possible states correspond to the actions available to the gods. As examined in the paper, our proposal offers a plausible interpretation of typical religious phenomena such as miracles, omens, and divination. Moreover, it captures important characteristics of religious beliefs including the notion that gods control multiple spheres of reality, are organized hierarchically, and control aspects that are salient for believers. Besides offering an intriguing new perspective on religion, the paper corroborates the possibility that the statistical brain hypothesis represents a unifying theory of the mind.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rigoli","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Lennon","given":"Jack"}],"citation-key":"rigoliGodsLatentCauses","container-title":"The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion","DOI":"10.1080/10508619.2024.2422173","ISSN":"1050-8619","issue":"0","page":"1-26","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Gods as Latent Causes: A Statistical Inference Theory of Religion","title-short":"The Gods as Latent Causes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10508619.2024.2422173","volume":"0"},

Little research has examined relations between rumination and health behaviors.We aimed to test links between rumination and health behaviors as well as possible moderators and mediators of those links.We used an 11-day online daily diary design. Health behavior outcomes included fruit intake, vegetable intake, exercise, alcohol intake, sexual risk taking behavior, and cigarette smoking.Rumination was related to alcohol intake at the within-person level. Using multivariate modeling, we found that significant within-person mediators for rumination to health behaviors included impulsivity, amotivation, self control, and using health behaviors as coping, with each of these mediating relationships for one to four out of the five health behavior outcomes.

They propose a three-part account of how such differential beliefs arise or, more precisely, an account of how prescriptive beliefs shape descriptive ones. The authors discuss people’s tendency to selectively expose themselves to ideologically sympathetic people, groups, and media sources also plays a significant role in the development of political conflict. Politics is and in fact should be about moral vision: individuals and political parties offering their unique vision of what is right and wrong for the country and its citizens, and how to realize that vision through public policy. Issue moralization occurs when people connect broad moral values to specific political issues. Consider the contentious issue of abortion in the United States. Imbuing political issues with morality can fuel commitment and spur action in supporters, but its cost is the implication that the opposition is acting immorally.","author":[{"family":"Ringel","given":"Megan M."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Cristian G."},{"family":"Ditto","given":"Peter H."}],"citation-key":"ringelWhatRightRight2018","container-title":"Belief Systems and the Perception of Reality","editor":[{"family":"Rutjens","given":"Bastiaan T."},{"family":"Brandt","given":"Mark J."}],"ISBN":"978-1-315-11490-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"number-of-pages":"22","publisher":"Routledge","title":"What is right is right: A three-part account of how ideology shapes factual belief","type":"chapter"},

The present studies (N ¼ 1,456) examine whether these reminders elicit stereotype threat (i.e., fear of confirming negative societal stereotypes about one’s group), disengagement (i.e., distancing oneself from a domain perceived as incongruent with the values of one’s group), or both. In Studies 1 and 2, Christians demonstrated lower task performance and greater subjective feelings of stereotype threat (but did not spend less time on the task) relative to non-Christians when beliefs about Christianity–science incompatibility were chronic or made salient. Furthermore, the effects of incompatibility stereotypes on performance were most pronounced among Christians who identified strongly with science and hence worried most about confirming negative stereotypes (Studies 3–4).

Our studies show that stereotypes about Christians being less competent in science than other groups are recognized by both Christians and non-Christians and are openly endorsed by non-Christians (Study 1). Our studies further demonstrate that when these stereotypes become salient, Christians are less interested in and identified with science (Study 2) and underperform on science-relevant tasks (Studies 3–5), compared to non-Christians. Even subtle contextual cues that bear more or less relevance to science are sufficient to compromise Christians’ scientific task performance, particularly among the highly religious (Study 5). When these stereotypes are explicitly removed, however, performance differences between Christians and non-Christians disappear. These results suggest that Christians’ awareness of the negative societal stereotypes about their group’s scientific competence may be partially responsible for the underperformance and underrepresentation of Christians in scientific fields.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Rios","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Zhen Hadassah"},{"family":"Totton","given":"Rebecca R."},{"family":"Shariff","given":"Azim F."}],"citation-key":"riosNegativeStereotypesCause2015","container-title":"Social Psychological and Personality Science","container-title-short":"Social Psychological and Personality Science","DOI":"10.1177/1948550615598378","ISSN":"1948-5506, 1948-5514","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","page":"959-967","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Negative Stereotypes Cause Christians to Underperform in and Disidentify With Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550615598378","volume":"6"},

In this cross-cultural study comparing Christian university students in the United States and Muslim university students in the United Arab Emirates, we examined time spent in Western countries (for UAE students) or overseas (for American students) as predictors of perceived religion-science compatibility. Drawing upon the notion that science is viewed as more secular in Christianity than in Islam, we hypothesized and found that among UAE students, number of weeks per year spent in the West correlated negatively with religion-science compatibility beliefs. This relationship held even when controlling for science knowledge, suggesting that it results not from epistemological opposition to science but from an increasing exposure to the idea that science should be seen as a secular institution.

Recent theoretical work suggests that people serve as means to one’s goals and have conceptualized romantic partners as multifinal means (fulfilling multiple goals). One consequence of a means being multifinal is that its instrumentality to any given goal is reduced, or diluted, with important consequences for how the means is evaluated. Specifically, people might prefer multifinal means because they are more valuable when they pursue multiple goals. However, when only one goal is accessible and important in the moment, multifinal means might be perceived as less instrumental and might be valued less. In these instances, people might prefer a means that only fulfills that goal. Applied to the context of romantic relationships, individuals may become relatively less satisfied with their multifinal romantic partners when one goal becomes particularly important. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally manipulating the number of accessible goals. We did not find support for the dilution hypothesis in the context of romantic relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberson","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Spielmann","given":"Stephanie S."},{"family":"Kopetz","given":"Catalina"}],"citation-key":"robersonWhenMoreMeans2020","container-title":"Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/23743603.2021.1983718","ISSN":"2374-3603","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"page":"345–359","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"When more means less: the impact of instrumentality dilution on evaluations of romantic relationships","title-short":"When more means less","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23743603.2021.1983718","volume":"4"},

This paper proposes some ways that intellectual character virtues might help correct these sources of epistemic unreliability. We begin with an overview of some insights from recent work in dual-process cognitive psychology regarding ‘biases and heuristics’, and argue that the dozens of hazards the psychologists catalogue arise from combinations and specifications of a small handful of more basic patterns of thinking. We expound four of these, and sketch how they conspire to produce the myriad biases, heuristics, and illusions. We then offer accounts of two character virtues—self-vigilance and intellectual vitality—and explain how these virtues could help correct our error-prone thinking. The self-vigilant person appreciates her vulnerability to natural epistemic defects, is on the watch for cues to the working of these possible error-makers, and intelligently acts to correct for them. The intellectually vital person is naturally or has learned to be energetic, active, alert, attentive, and inquisitive, contrary to the natural tendency to cognitive laziness. We suggest that these intellectual virtues, like the moral virtues, will cluster in the personality, and will tend to be mutually reinforcing and mutually recruiting, even as each has its own corrective function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"West","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"robertsNaturalEpistemicDefects2015","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-015-0669-5","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2557-2576","source":"Springer Link","title":"Natural epistemic defects and corrective virtues","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0669-5","volume":"192"},

This discussion has, above all, contributed to what we might call a revaluation of value: from the point of view of the epistemologist or philosopher of science values are neither uniform nor uniformly “bad”.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rooney","given":"Phyllis"}],"citation-key":"rooneyValuesScienceEpistemic1992","container-title":"PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association","DOI":"10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.1.192740","ISSN":"0270-8647, 2327-9486","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"1992/ed"},"language":"en","page":"13-22","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"On Values in Science: Is the Epistemic/Non-Epistemic Distinction Useful?","title-short":"On Values in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psa-proceedings-of-the-biennial-meeting-of-the-philosophy-of-science-association/article/abs/on-values-in-science-is-the-epistemicnonepistemic-distinction-useful/46933CCE91D1753E1EAF0E275A17823F","volume":"1992"},

  {"id":"roosMeasuringScienceReligion2014","abstract":"High scientific literacy is widely considered a public good. Methods of assessing public scientific knowledge or literacy are equally important. In an effort to measure lay scientific literacy in the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) science literacy scale has been a part of the last three waves of the General Social Survey. However, there has been debate over the validity of some survey items as indicators of science knowledge. While many researchers treat the NSF science scale as measuring a single dimension, previous work (Bann and Schwerin, 2004; Miller, 1998, 2004) suggests a bidimensional structure. This paper hypothesizes and tests a new measurement model for the NSF science knowledge scale and finds that two items about evolution and the big bang are more measures of a religious belief dimension termed “Young Earth Worldview” than they are measures of scientific knowledge.

Given the often redundant nature of new scales, psychological science is struggling with arbitrary measurement, construct dilution, and disconnection between research groups. To address these issues, we introduce an easy-to-use online application: the Semantic Scale Network. The purpose of this application is to automatically detect semantic overlap between scales through latent semantic analysis. Authors and reviewers can enter the items of a new scale into the application, and receive quantifications of semantic overlap with related scales in the application’s corpus. Contrary to traditional assessments of scale overlap, the application can support expert judgments on scale redundancy without access to empirical data or awareness of every potentially related scale. After a brief introduction to measures of semantic similarity in texts, we introduce the Semantic Scale Network and provide best practices for interpreting its outputs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenbusch","given":"Hannes"},{"family":"Wanders","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Pit","given":"Ilse L."}],"citation-key":"rosenbuschSemanticScaleNetwork2020","container-title":"Psychological Methods","container-title-short":"Psychological Methods","DOI":"10/gg5rn7","ISSN":"1939-1463, 1082-989X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"380-392","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Semantic Scale Network: An online tool to detect semantic overlap of psychological scales and prevent scale redundancies.","title-short":"The Semantic Scale Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/met0000244","volume":"25"},

With regard to computer science, a “hard” discipline, we expected absolute beliefs (knowledge as objective “truths”) to increase over time. In contrast, in the more “soft” discipline of psychology, we expected absolute beliefs to be low and stable, and multiplistic beliefs (knowledge as subjective “opinions”) to follow an inversely U-shaped trajectory. Hypotheses were tested in a three-semester long four-wave study with 226 undergraduates. Data were analysed by multi-group growth modelling for parallel processes. In computer science, absolute beliefs indeed increased over the study period. In psychology, an initial increase in multiplistic beliefs was followed by a steep decrease. We therefore suggest that epistemic “sophistication” should be conceived of as a flexible adaptation of epistemic judgments to the characteristics of specific contexts, and not as a generalized developmental sequence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosman","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Anne-Kathrin"},{"family":"Kerwer","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Krampen","given":"Günter"}],"citation-key":"rosmanDifferentialDevelopmentEpistemic2017","container-title":"Learning and Instruction","container-title-short":"Learning and Instruction","DOI":"10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.01.006","ISSN":"0959-4752","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"166-177","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The differential development of epistemic beliefs in psychology and computer science students: A four-wave longitudinal study","title-short":"The differential development of epistemic beliefs in psychology and computer science students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475217300531","volume":"49"},

We strived to replicate this finding and to extend this work by analyzing other factors that might lead to scientific impotence excuses. As a person-specific factor, we analyzed the role of epistemic beliefs, and as a situational factor, we focused on the contradictoriness of the evidence at hand. Three sets of hypotheses were preregistered. In an experimental 2 × 3 online study drawing on a general population sample of N = 901 participants, we first assessed our participants’ prior beliefs on the effects of acupuncture versus massaging (pro acupuncture vs. no opinion). One experimental group then read fictitious empirical evidence claiming superiority of acupuncture, another group read evidence speaking against acupuncture, and a third group read conflicting evidence (i.e., a mix of pro- and contra-findings). Scientific impotence excuses were measured by a newly developed questionnaire. Our first hypothesis, which suggested that participants believing in the superiority of acupuncture would make stronger scientific impotence excuses when confronted with belief-disconfirming findings, was confirmed. A second hypothesis suggested that scientific impotence excuses would be stronger when individuals were confronted with evidence exhibiting a “nature” that contradicts their topic-specific epistemic beliefs. This hypothesis was partially supported. A third hypothesis suggested that individuals confronted with conflicting evidence would make stronger scientific impotence excuses, and this was again confirmed.

Yet, public confidence in vaccination is waning, driven in part by the ‘manufacture of doubt’ by anti-vaccination activists and websites. However, there is little research examining the psychological underpinnings of anti-vaccination rhetoric among parents.\nObjectives\nHere, we examined the structure and moral roots of anti-vaccination attitudes amongst Australian parents active on social media parenting sites.\nMethods\nParticipants (N = 296) completed questionnaires assessing their vaccination attitudes, behavioural intentions, and moral preferences.\nResults\nUsing Latent Profile Analysis, we identified three profiles (i.e., groups), interpretable as vaccine “accepters”, “fence sitters”, and “rejecters”, each characterised by a distinct pattern of vaccination attitudes and moral preferences. Accepters exhibited positive vaccination attitudes and strong intentions to vaccinate; rejecters exhibited the opposite pattern of responses; whilst fence sitters exhibited an intermediate pattern of responses. Compared to accepters, rejecters and fence sitters exhibited a heightened moral preference for liberty (belief in the rights of the individual) and harm (concern about the wellbeing of others).

  {"id":"rossenGoingGrainCognition2016","abstract":"Childhood vaccination is widely considered to be one of the most successful public health interventions. Yet, the effective delivery of vaccination depends upon public willingness to vaccinate. Recently, many countries have faced problems with vaccine hesitancy, where a growing number of parents perceive vaccination to be unsafe or unnecessary, leading some to delay or refuse vaccines for their children. Effective intervention strategies for countering this problem are currently sorely lacking, however. Here, we propose that this may be because existing strategies are grounded more in intuition than insights from psychology. Consequently, such strategies are sometimes at variance with basic psychological principles and assumptions. By going against the grain of cognition, such strategies potentially run the risk of undermining persuasive efforts to reduce vaccine hesitancy. We demonstrate this by drawing on key insights from cognitive and social psychology to show how various known features of human psychology can lead many intuitively appealing intervention strategies to backfire, yielding unintended and undesirable repercussions. We conclude with a summary of potential avenues of investigation that may be more effective in addressing vaccine hesitancy. Our key message is that intervention strategies must be crafted that go with the grain of cognition by incorporating key insights from the psychological sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossen","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Hurlstone","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Carmen"}],"citation-key":"rossenGoingGrainCognition2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Shaped and forged over the course of the twentieth century, it has reflected the interests and political situation of the world at the time.

This volume showcases new work and new approaches to religion which work across boundaries of religious tradition, academic discipline and region. The influence of globalizing processes has been evident in social and cultural networking by way of new media like the internet, in the extensive power of global capitalism and in the increasing influence of international bodies and legal instruments. Religion has been changing and adapting too. This handbook offers fresh insights on the dynamic reality of religion in global societies today by underscoring transformations in eight key areas: Market and Branding; Contemporary Ethics and Virtues; Intimate Identities; Transnational Movements; Diasporic Communities; Responses to Diversity; National Tensions; and Reflections on 'Religion'. These themes demonstrate the handbook's new topics and approaches that move beyond existing agendas.

Moralization is often linked to health concerns, including addiction. It is significant because moralized entities are more likely to receive attention from governments and institutions, to encourage supportive scientific research, to license censure, to become internalized, to show enhanced parent-to-child transmission of attitudes, to motivate the search by individuals for supporting reasons, and, in at least some cases, to recruit the emotion of disgust. Moralization seems to be promoted in predominantly Protestant cultures and if the entity is associated with stigmatized groups or harmful to children.

  {"id":"russellWhatCounterintuitiveReligious2013","abstract":"What is ‘counterintuitive’? There is general agreement that it refers to a violation of previously held knowledge, but the precise definition seems to vary with every author and study. The aim of this paper is to deconstruct the notion of ‘counterintuitive’ and provide a more philosophically rigorous definition congruent with the history of psychology, recent experimental work in ‘minimally counterintuitive’ concepts, the science vs. religion debate, and the developmental and evolutionary background of human beings. We conclude that previous definitions of counterintuitiveness have been flawed and did not resolve the conflict between a believer’s conception of the supernatural entity (an atypical “real kind”) and the non-believer’s conception (empty name/fictional). Furthermore, too much emphasis has been placed on the universality and (presumed) innateness of intuitive concepts (and hence the criteria for what is counterintuitive)—and far too little attention paid to learning and expertise. We argue that many putatively universal concepts are not innate, but mostly learned and defeasible—part of a religious believer’s repertoire of expert knowledge. Nonetheless, the results from empirical studies about the memorability of counterintuitive concepts have been convincing and it is difficult to improve on existing designs and methodologies. However, future studies in counterintuitive concepts need to embed their work in research about context effects, typicality, the psychology of learning and expertise (for example, the formation of expert templates and range defaults), with more attention to the sources of knowledge (direct and indirect knowledge) and a better idea of what ‘default’ knowledge really is.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Yvan I."},{"family":"Gobet","given":"Fernand"}],"citation-key":"russellWhatCounterintuitiveReligious2013","container-title":"Review of Philosophy and Psychology","container-title-short":"Rev.Phil.Psych.","DOI":"10.1007/s13164-013-0160-5","ISSN":"1878-5166","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"715-749","source":"Springer Link","title":"What is Counterintuitive?

Accordingly, research on why people increasingly doubt science and endorse ?alternative facts? is flourishing. Much of this work has focused on identifying cognitive biases and individual differences. Importantly, however, the reasons that lead people to question mainstream scientific findings and share misinformation are also inherently tied to social processes that emerge out of divisive commitments to group identities and worldviews. In this special issue, we focus on the important and thus far neglected role of group processes in motivating science skepticism. The articles that feature in this special issue cover three core areas: the group-based roots of antiscience attitudes; the intergroup dynamics between science and conspiratorial thinking; and finally, insights about science denial related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across all articles, we highlight the role of worldviews, identities, norms, religion, and other inter- and intragroup processes that shape antiscientific attitudes.

  {"id":"rutjensImmoralLandscapeScientists2016","abstract":"Do people think that scientists are bad people? Although surveys find that science is a highly respected profession, a growing discourse has emerged regarding how science is often judged negatively. We report ten studies (N = 2328) that investigated morality judgments of scientists and compared those with judgments of various control groups, including atheists. A persistent intuitive association between scientists and disturbing immoral conduct emerged for violations of the binding moral foundations, particularly when this pertained to violations of purity. However, there was no association in the context of the individualizing moral foundations related to fairness and care. Other evidence found that scientists were perceived as similar to others in their concerns with the individualizing moral foundations of fairness and care, yet as departing for all of the binding foundations of loyalty, authority, and purity. Furthermore, participants stereotyped scientists particularly as robot-like and lacking emotions, as well as valuing knowledge over morality and being potentially dangerous. The observed intuitive immorality associations are partially due to these explicit stereotypes but do not correlate with any perceived atheism. We conclude that scientists are perceived not as inherently immoral, but as capable of immoral conduct.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Rutjens","given":"Bastiaan T."},{"family":"Heine","given":"Steven J."}],"citation-key":"rutjensImmoralLandscapeScientists2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152798","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"e0152798","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The Immoral Landscape?

We report three studies—including an analysis of large-scale survey data—in which we systematically investigate the ideological antecedents of general faith in science and willingness to support science, as well as of science skepticism of climate change, vaccination, and genetic modification (GM). The main predictors are religiosity and political orientation, morality, and science understanding. Overall, science understanding is associated with vaccine and GM food acceptance, but not climate change acceptance. Importantly, different ideological predictors are related to the acceptance of different scientific findings. Political conservatism best predicts climate change skepticism. Religiosity, alongside moral purity concerns, best predicts vaccination skepticism. GM food skepticism is not fueled by religious or political ideology. Finally, religious conservatives consistently display a low faith in science and an unwillingness to support science.

Recent research highlighting the role of ideologies and worldviews in shaping science skepticism can inform research questions as well as pandemic responses to COVID-19. It is likely that the antecedents of general COVID-19-related skepticism substantially overlap with the antecedents of climate change skepticism. Additionally, skepticism about a potential vaccine in particular will likely be fueled by similar worries and misperceptions to those shaping more general antivaccination attitudes, of which conspiracy thinking is particularly worth highlighting.

Results indicate that various previously reported findings hold up: Mirroring North American patterns, climate change skepticism is associated with political conservatism (but only modestly), and scientific literacy does not contribute to skepticism, except about genetic modification (Study 1 only) and vaccine skepticism (Study 2 only). Results also reveal a crucial difference: Religiosity does not consistently contribute to science skepticism, except about evolution. Instead, spirituality is found to most consistently predict vaccine skepticism and low general faith in science—which in turn predicts willingness to support science.

It is clear that such interventions need to be addressed to children of younger ages while they are still shaping their interests and aspirations towards scientific careers. In this study, we designed and delivered scientific workshops to 86 vulnerable children (8–13 years-old) at risk of social exclusion, belonging to low-income communities and minorities that have been historically excluded of this sort of learning opportunities. Scientific workshops were implemented as out-of-school activities since this practice has been recognized as a successful educational action. Results show a positive impact of science workshops in improving some of the science capital dimensions and in shaping a more inclusive science identity in which girls and ethnic minorities have a better fit allowing them to elevate their scientific and educational aspirations.

  {"id":"sanchezStakeholderViewsPractical2021","abstract":"Objective\nEpilepsy is one of the most prevalent, treatable neurological diseases globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, people with epilepsy (PWE) frequently seek treatment from traditional or pastoral healers, who are more accessible than biomedical care providers. This often contributes to the substantial time delay in obtaining adequate biomedical care for these patients. In Uganda, the few biomedical providers who can treat epilepsy cannot meet the great need for epilepsy care. Additionally, patients are often hesitant to seek biomedical care, often preferring the easily accessible and trusted sociocultural treatment options. This study sought to elucidate the barriers to biomedical care for PWE as well as identify potential solutions to overcome these barriers from various stakeholder perspectives.\nMethods\nThis study used qualitative research methods. Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with four major stakeholder groups: PWE or family members of PWE, neurologists and psychiatrists, traditional healers, and pastoral healers. All interviews and focus group discussions that were in English were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Those that were not in English were translated live and audio recorded. A translator later translated the non-English portion of audio recording to ensure proper interpretation. Two independent coders coded the dataset and conducted an inter-rater reliability (IRR) assessment to ensure reliable coding of the data. Thematic analysis was then performed to discern themes from the data and compare nuances between each of the study design groups.\nResults\nParticipants discussed several different causes of epilepsy ranging from spiritual to biological causes, often incorporating elements of both. Commonly endorsed spiritual causes of epilepsy included witchcraft and ancestral spirits. Commonly endorsed biological causes included genetics, fever, malaria, and brain injury. For patients and families, beliefs about the cause of epilepsy often played a role in whom they chose to seek treatment from. Three major barriers to biomedical care were discussed: practical barriers, medical infrastructure barriers, and barriers related to stigma. Practical barriers related to issues such as transportation, cost of medical care, and distance to the nearest healthcare facility. Under medical infrastructure, drug stock-outs and lack of access to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were the most consistent problems stated among patients. Stigma was heavily discussed and brought up by nearly every participant. Additionally, three significant solutions to improving epilepsy care in Uganda were highlighted by participants: collaboration among treatment providers, community sensitization efforts to address stigma, and building medical infrastructure. Within building infrastructure, all participant types, except traditional healers, proposed the development of an epilepsy clinic designed to specifically treat epilepsy.\nConclusions\nBased on these findings, there are four critical interventions that should be considered for improving epilepsy care in Uganda: the creation of dedicated epilepsy clinics, infrastructure strengthening to address medication stock-outs, community outreach programs for sensitization, and collaboration between biomedical providers and traditional healers.

  {"id":"sarathchandraSurveyInstrumentMeasuring2018","abstract":"Accurately measuring vaccine acceptance is important, especially under current conditions in which misinformation may increase public anxiety about vaccines and politicize vaccination policies. We integrated substantive knowledge, conceptualization and measurement expertise, and survey design principles to develop an instrument for measuring vaccine acceptance across the general public. Given this broad goal, we expect our novel instrument will complement, rather than replace, existing instruments designed specifically to measure parents' vaccine hesitancy. Our instrument measures five key facets of vaccine acceptance: (1) perceived safety of vaccines; (2) perceived effectiveness and necessity of vaccines; (3) acceptance of the selection and scheduling of vaccines; (4) positive values and affect toward vaccines; and (5) perceived legitimacy of authorities to require vaccinations. We report results of analyses demonstrating the reliability and validity of this instrument. High Cronbach's alpha values for five sub-scales and for the full scale indicate the instrument's reliability, and the consistent performance of expected predictors (i.e., trust in biologists, conspiratorial ideation, and political ideology) demonstrates the instrument's construct validity. Further, scientific reasoning increases vaccine acceptance among liberals but decreases vaccine acceptance among conservatives, which is consistent with motivated cognition. Also, trust in biologists has a stronger positive effect on vaccine acceptance among conservatives than among liberals, signaling a potentially promising means to reduce political polarization on vaccines and increase vaccine acceptance across the general public. We end by identifying key ways that public health researchers, science studies scholars, and health practitioners may employ the full (or short) version of our vaccine acceptance instrument.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarathchandra","given":"Dilshani"},{"family":"Navin","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Largent","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"McCright","given":"Aaron M."}],"citation-key":"sarathchandraSurveyInstrumentMeasuring2018","container-title":"Preventive Medicine","container-title-short":"Preventive Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2018.01.006","ISSN":"0091-7435","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A survey instrument for measuring vaccine acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743518300069","volume":"109"},

In line with the intuitive belief hypothesis, a negative correlation between reﬂectiveness and religious belief emerged, at least in one of the experimental conditions. In contrast to that hypothesis, however, the results revealed no eﬀect of the cognitive style manipulation on religious belief. Although a self-report measure (Faith in Intuition) provided evidence that the manipulation worked as intended, it did not inﬂuence actual performance (Cognitive Reﬂection Test), suggesting a demand eﬀect problem.

  {"id":"saroglouCulturePersonalityReligiosity2017","abstract":"Not all people around the world are religious; in all societies, there are believers and nonbelievers who coexist. Among both the religious and nonbelievers, not all hold their beliefs, world views, and values in exactly the same way or for exactly the same motives. This is true both within and across societies and cultural and religious groups. The present chapter focuses on the interplay between personality, religiosity, and culture. Specifically, it examines whether the personality characteristics associated with religiosity are universal or different across cultural contexts, or, more exactly, the extent to which they are both universal and culturally different. The chapter is divided into four sections. The first, short introductory section exposes the ways to conceptualize the links between personality and religiosity. A second section examines whether the personality characteristics associated with religiosity are universal, that is, found not only in Western contexts and groups of Christian tradition but also in non- Western societies and other religions. It also examines the question of isomorphism, that is, whether the personality correlates of religiosity at the individual level are the same as those at the collective (country, region) level. A third major section focuses on cultural differences between countries, world regions, or large civilizational zones in the strength or even direction of the personality-religiosity associations. Importantly, it provides theory and interpretation of the observed cross-cultural differences in the personality characteristics associated with religiosity. It also briefly examines applications of the above cross-cultural differences for some key domains of human psychology, such as morality, prosocial behavior, intergroup relations, sexuality, and well-being. Finally, the General Discussion closes with an integrative synthesis and questions for future investigations.

Instead of equally encompassing prosocial (care for others) and other values (duties to the self, the community, and the sacred), religiosity implies a restrictive morality: endorsement of values denoting social order (conservation, loyalty, and authority), self-control (low autonomy and self-expansion), and purity more strongly than care; and, furthermore, a deontological, non-consequentialist, righteous orientation, that could result in harm to (significant) others. Religious moral righteousness is highest in fundamentalism and weakens in secular countries. Only spirituality reflects an extended morality (care, fairness, and the binding foundations).

  {"id":"scheufeleReligiousBeliefsPublic2009","abstract":"How do citizens make sense of nanotechnology as more applications reach the market and the mainstream media start to debate the potential risks and benefits of technology? As with many other political and scientific issues, citizens rely on cognitive shortcuts or heuristics to make sense of issues for which they have low levels of knowledge. These heuristics can include predispositional factors, such as ideological beliefs or value systems, and also short-term frames of reference provided by the media or other sources of information. Recent research suggests that 'religious filters' are an important heuristic for scientific issues in general, and nanotechnology in particular. A religious filter is more than a simple correlation between religiosity and attitudes toward science: it refers to a link between benefit perceptions and attitudes that varies depending on respondents' levels of religiosity. In surveys, seeing the benefits of nanotechnology is consistently linked to more positive attitudes about nanotechnology among less religious respondents, with this effect being significantly weaker for more religious respondents. For this study, we have combined public opinion surveys in the United States with Eurobarometer surveys about public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe to compare the influence of religious beliefs on attitudes towards nanotechnology in the United States and Europe. Our results show that respondents in the United States were significantly less likely to agree that nanotechnology is morally acceptable than respondents in many European countries. These moral views correlated directly with aggregate levels of religiosity in each country, even after controlling for national research productivity and measures of science performance for high-school students.","author":[{"family":"Scheufele","given":"Dietram A."},{"family":"Corley","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Shih","given":"Tsung-jen"},{"family":"Dalrymple","given":"Kajsa E."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Shirley S."}],"citation-key":"scheufeleReligiousBeliefsPublic2009","container-title":"Nature Nanotechnology","container-title-short":"Nat Nanotechnol","DOI":"10.1038/nnano.2008.361","ISSN":"1748-3395","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"91-94","PMID":"19197309","source":"PubMed","title":"Religious beliefs and public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe and the United States","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"schieferEpistemicBeliefsScience2022","abstract":"Recent research has integrated developmental and dimensional perspectives on epistemic beliefs by implementing an approach in which profiles of learners’ epistemic beliefs are modeled across multiple dimensions. Variability in study characteristics has impeded the comparison of profiles of epistemic beliefs and their relations with external variables across studies. We examined this comparability by integrating data on epistemic beliefs about the source, certainty, development, and justification of knowledge in science from six studies comprising N = 10,932 German students from elementary to upper secondary school. Applying latent profile analyses to these data, we found that profiles of epistemic beliefs that were previously conceptualized were robust across multiple samples. We found indications that profiles of epistemic beliefs homogenize over the course of students’ education, are related to school tracking, and demonstrate robust relations with students’ personal characteristics and socioeconomic background. We discuss implications for the theory, assessment, and education of epistemic beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiefer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Edelsbrunner","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Bernholt","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Kampa","given":"Nele"},{"family":"Nehring","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"schieferEpistemicBeliefsScience2022","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Educ Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10648-022-09661-w","ISSN":"1573-336X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,12]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Epistemic Beliefs in Science—A Systematic Integration of Evidence From Multiple Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-022-09661-w"},

  {"id":"schiopReligionPandemic2021","abstract":"After various global crises began to recover, the challenge posed by the coronavirus, the unseen enemy, diverted attention from other issues considered less urgent. The paper will focus primarily on the description of the article by Giorgio Agamben, who is one of the greatest philosophers alive today. The article deals with the way in which science and medicine have become the “religion” of our times, especially in the context of current challenges, such as the pandemic. In the modern West, three major belief systems have coexisted and, to some extent, still coexist Christianity, capitalism, and science. In the history of modernity, these three “religions” have often intersected, coming into conflict from time to time, only to reconcile in various ways, until they have gradually reached a kind of peaceful and articulate coexistence, if not to true and adequate collaboration in the name of common interest. According to Cătălin Raiu, Europe has not only a venerable Christian tradition but also political structures born of or in relation to Christianity. Secondly, the paper is analyzing the right to health, but also to religious freedom, observing the border between the two. Later the paper is observing in the case studies how some countries approached religion during the pandemic. There have been many cases of churches suing the state that closed them, recently in Madrid and California. This topic is a topical one, currently feeling the effects of restrictions on the religious phenomenon in a negative sense. Regarding the methodology, the article starts with the presentation of the context in order to create an overview of the phenomenon (the sources being both general and special, to highlight elements from several areas), but is does not neglect elements of originality resulting from the analysis of the legislation (official sources providing objective points of view through document analysis) and its implementation, but also from case studies (both by examples of good practice and by negative examples).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiop","given":"Emilia Nicoleta"}],"citation-key":"schiopReligionPandemic2021","container-title":"Eurolimes","ISSN":"1841-9259","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"English","page":"271-281","publisher":"Editura Universitatii din Oradea","source":"www.ceeol.com","title":"Religion during the Pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1043441","volume":"30"},

This study examined if self-identiﬁed atheists, agnostics, and humanists differed systematically with regard to worldview dimensions. Cultural and gender effects were examined as secondary study objectives. A total of 1,814 nonreligious individuals from Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands completed questionnaires measuring degrees of atheism, agnosticism, humanism, personal responsibility, scientism, economic materialism, skepticism, dogmatism, existential search, and concealment and disclosure of convictions. As expected, self-identiﬁed atheists, agnostics, and humanists differed substantially in their worldview positions and communication. Across all three countries, atheists endorsed atheism to a very high degree. Compared to agnostics and humanists, they were more convinced of scientism and less of skepticism. Agnostics scored highest in agnosticism and skepticism and lowest in dogmatism. Humanists mostly held distinguishable middle positions between atheists and agnostics. Analyses of cultural differences supported the hypothesis that more religious contexts give rise to secular countermovements: In (more religious/less secular) Austria and Germany, atheism, scientism, personal responsibility, and disclosure were more pronounced than in the (secular) Netherlands, where agnosticism and skepticism were more prevalent. Regarding gender, men scored higher on atheism and scientism, and women on skepticism. The ﬁndings suggest a continuum from decided to open secularity, two clearly distinct positions. Decided (atheist, scientist, disclosing) secularity was more common among self-identiﬁed atheists, men, and in more religious contexts. Open (agnostic, skeptic) secularity was more prominent among self-identiﬁed agnostics, women, and in the more secular culture. Self-identiﬁed humanists occupied a middle position.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Schnell","given":"Tatjana"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Elpine","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Alma","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"schnellWorldsApartAtheist2021","container-title":"Psychology of Religion and Spirituality","container-title-short":"Psychology of Religion and Spirituality","DOI":"10.1037/rel0000446","ISSN":"1943-1562, 1941-1022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,7]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Worlds apart?

Adults (N = 174) ranging in age from 17 to 71 years old with a mean age of 38 completed the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire (M.

After they had completed the questionnaire, they responded to a series of questions about two controversial issues that had been discussed in the local newspaper. Regression analyses indicated that the more the participants believed in complex and tentative knowledge, the more likely they were to take on multiple perspectives, be willing to modify their thinking, withhold ultimate decisions until all information was available, and acknowledge the complex, tentative nature of everyday issues. Epistemological beliefs that are heavily influenced by a higher level of education appear to relate to thinking beyond the classroom, and introducing controversial issues into the curriculum may reciprocally foster the development of epistemological beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schommer-Aikins","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Hutter","given":"Rosetta"}],"citation-key":"schommer-aikinsEpistemologicalBeliefsThinking2002","container-title":"The Journal of Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/00223980209604134","ISSN":"0022-3980","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",1,1]]},"page":"5-20","PMID":"12022777","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Epistemological Beliefs and Thinking About Everyday Controversial Issues","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980209604134","volume":"136"},

  {"id":"schommerInfluenceAgeEducation1998","abstract":"Background. Individuals' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, or epistemological beliefs, have been linked to their comprehension, meta-comprehension, persistence, and interpretation of information (e.g., Kitchener & King, 1981; Ryan, 1984; Songer & Linn, 1991). Little is known about the development of epistemological beliefs. Aims. This research examines the contributions of age and education to adults' epistemological beliefs. Sample. A total of 418 adults from all walks of life (e.g., homemakers, waitresses, teachers, farmers, carpenters, executives, and lawyers) participated in this study. Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that one-third of the sample had only a high school education, another third had some college undergraduate experience, and the other third had some graduate school experience. Method. Adults completed an epistemological questionnaire that assesses beliefs about the structure and stability of knowledge, and the speed and control of learning. Results. To ensure that the epistemological questionnaire was suitable for this sample, a factor analysis was carried out. Factor scores that were generated replicated a factor structure that had been found in earlier studies (Dunkle, Schraw & Bendixen, 1993; Schommer, 1990). Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that education predicted beliefs about the structure and stability of knowledge. Age predicted beliefs about the ability to learn. Conclusions. This evidence suggests that both age and education affect individuals' epistemological beliefs in unique ways. This may have implications for older adults who return to school eager to learn but with misunderstandings about the nature of knowledge, and younger adults who attend school with doubts about the malleability of the ability to learn.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Schommer","given":"Marlene"}],"citation-key":"schommerInfluenceAgeEducation1998","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/j.2044-8279.1998.tb01311.x","ISSN":"2044-8279","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"551-562","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The influence of age and education on epistemological beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1998.tb01311.x","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"schoorScienceutilitySciencetrustAssociations2021","abstract":"Knowledge about how science works, trust in scientists, and the perceived utility of science currently appear to be eroding in these times in which “alternative facts” or personal experiences and opinions are used as arguments. Yet, in many situations, it would be beneficial for the individual and all of society if scientific findings were considered in decision-making. For this to happen, people have to trust in scientists and perceive science as useful. Still, in university contexts, it might not be desirable to report negative beliefs about science. In addition, science-utility and science-trust associations may differ from explicit beliefs because associations were learned through the co-occurrence of stimuli rather than being based on propositional reasoning. We developed two IATs to measure science-utility and science-trust associations in university students and tested the psychometric properties and predictive potential of these measures. In a study of 261 university students, the IATs were found to have good psychometric properties and small correlations with their corresponding self-report scales. Science-utility and science-trust associations predicted knowledge about how science works over and above self-reported beliefs. The results suggest that indirect measures are useful for assessing beliefs about science and can be used to predict outcome measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schoor","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Schütz","given":"Astrid"}],"citation-key":"schoorScienceutilitySciencetrustAssociations2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0260586","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e0260586","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Science-utility and science-trust associations and how they relate to knowledge about how science works","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260586","volume":"16"},

(2001) begin with a probing discussion of knowledge, beliefs, and how science educators might distinguish between them. Southerland et al. review the traditional Platonic view, which deﬁnes belief as faith in a claim and knowledge as a justiﬁed true belief in a claim. They next compare two contemporary epistemological world views, one based on fallibilism (Popper, 1959) and one based on radical constructivism (Cobern, 2000). The fallibilist view maintains that knowledge can be distinguished from beliefs on the basis of sufﬁcient logical and empirical warrants, whereas the radical constructivist view argues that such a distinction is impossible because all epistemological claims are ﬁltered through idiosyncratic personal experiences that preclude the evidential utility of warrants.","author":[{"family":"Schraw","given":"Gregory"}],"citation-key":"schrawCurrentThemesFuture2001","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Current Themes and Future Directions in Epistemological Research: A Commentary","type":"article-journal"},

The results from five studies supported this hypothesis. Study 1 demonstrated the counterfinality effect in an applied context: The more pain people experienced when getting tattooed, the more they perceived getting tattooed as instrumental to attaining their idiosyncratic goals (being unique, showing off, etc.). Study 2 experimentally replicated and extended the results of Study 1: A counterfinal (vs. non-counterfinal) consumer product was perceived as more detrimental, which in turn predicted the perceived effectiveness of the product. In Studies 3 and 5, we showed that increased perceived instrumentality due to counterfinality led to more positive attitudes toward a means. Finally, Studies 4 and 5 indicated that simultaneous commitment to both the focal and the alternative goal moderated the counterfinality effect. We discuss how various psychological phenomena can be subsumed under the general framework of counterfinality, which has broad practical implications extending to consumer behavior, health psychology, and terrorism.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schumpe","given":"Birga M."},{"family":"Bélanger","given":"Jocelyn J."},{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."}],"citation-key":"schumpeCounterfinalityIncreasedPerceived2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"scialabbaMeansAreMeaningful","abstract":"People who have made little progress toward a goal are in a different psychological state than those who have made significant progress toward it, causing the available means of goal pursuit to differentially influence subsequent self-regulation. In this work, I hypothesized that people with lesser goal progress would be motivated by larger, more varied means sets, whereas people with greater goal progress would be motivated by smaller, less varied means sets. The former offers low progress people multiple opportunities for goal attainment success, and the latter minimizes choice and allows high progress people to have an efficient continued pursuit of the goal. I investigated this hypothesis across three studies. Study 1 demonstrated that, when in a goal progress mindset, participants report stronger goal pursuit intentions when they had a more variable means set available than a less variable means set. Probing this relationship further, Study 2 found that participants who perceived high, but not low, goal progress reported stronger goal pursuit intentions with a less variable means set than a more variable one. Study 3 replicated and extended the findings from Study 2 by demonstrating that participants who perceived low, but not high, goal progress evaluate more variable means sets more positively than less variable means sets. Implications for self-regulation are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Scialabba","given":"Elena E"}],"citation-key":"scialabbaMeansAreMeaningful","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Means are Meaningful: The Effects of Perceived Goal Progress and Means Set Variability on","type":"article-journal"},

We provide an overview of the importance and regulation of genetically engineered food and lay attitudes toward it. We first discuss the pronaturalness context in the United States and Europe that preceded the appearance of genetically engineered food. We then review the definition, prevalence, and regulation of this type of food. Genetically engineered food is widespread in some countries, but there is great controversy worldwide among individuals, governments, and other institutions about the advisability of growing and consuming it. In general, life scientists have a much more positive view of genetically engineered food than laypeople. We examine the bases of lay opposition to genetically engineered food and the evidence for how attitudes change. Laypeople tend to see genetically engineered food as dangerous and offering few benefits. We suggest that much of the lay opposition is morally based. One possibility is that, in some contexts, people view nature and naturalness as sacred and genetically engineered food as a violation of naturalness. We also suggest that for many people these perceptions of naturalness and attitudes toward genetically engineered food follow the sympathetic magical law of contagion, in which even minimal contact between a natural food and an unnatural entity, either a scientist or a piece of foreign DNA, pollutes or contaminates the natural entity and renders it unacceptable or even immoral to consume.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Sydney E."},{"family":"Inbar","given":"Yoel"},{"family":"Wirz","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Brossard","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Rozin","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"scottOverviewAttitudesGenetically2018","container-title":"Annual Review of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-nutr-071715-051223","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"459-479","PMID":"29801421","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"An Overview of Attitudes Toward Genetically Engineered Food","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-071715-051223","volume":"38"},

In total, we analyzed 380 comments from 25 e-petitions using a qualitative approach.

Additionally, matrix nodes analysis showed identification with Islam was related to solidarity.

The direction of the effect is theoretically not clear: war exposure may strengthen individuals' religiosity. Alternatively, after war exposure, individuals may stop following religion, and decrease their faith in God. To assess the direction of this effect, this study examines individuals' religiosity before and after a war between Israel and a Lebanese terror organization in 2006. Using both longitudinal and cross-section datasets, I find that being exposed to war or residing in war-affected regions increases individuals' religious behaviors and beliefs. These results are more pronounced among lower-educated individuals and among those who were not religious prior to the violence. Exploring possible mechanisms, I show that individuals become more religious as a means for coping with the adverse psychological effects of the war.

  {"id":"shapiroVaccineHesitancyScale2018","abstract":"Introduction\nThe SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy developed a vaccine hesitancy measure, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS). This scale has the potential to aid in the advancement of research and immunization policy but has not yet been psychometrically evaluated.\nMethods\nUsing a cross-sectional design, we collected self-reported survey data from a large national sample of Canadian parents from August to September 2016. An online questionnaire was completed in English or French. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify latent constructs underlying parents' responses to 10 VHS items (response scale 1–5, with higher scores indicating greater hesitancy). In addition to the VHS, measures included socio-demographics items, vaccine attitudes, parents’ human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine decision-making stage, and vaccine refusal.\nResults\nA total of 3779 Canadian parents completed the survey in English (74.1%) or French (25.9%). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure best explained the data, consisting of ‘lack of confidence’ (M = 1.98, SD = 0.72) and ‘risks’ (M = 3.07, SD = 0.95). Significant Pearson correlations were found between the scales and related vaccine attitudes. ANOVA analyses found significant differences in the VHS sub-scales by parents’ vaccine decision-making stages (p < .001). Independent samples t-tests found that the VHS sub-scales were associated with HPV vaccine refusal and refusing another vaccine (p < .001). Socio-demographic differences in the VHS were found; however, effect sizes were small (η2 < 0.02).\nConclusions\nThe VHS was found to have two factors that have construct and criterion validity in identifying vaccine hesitant parents. A limitation of the VHS was few items that loaded on the ‘risks’ component and a lack of positively and negatively worded items for both components. Based on these results, we suggest modifying the wording of some items and adding items on risk perceptions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Gilla K."},{"family":"Tatar","given":"Ovidiu"},{"family":"Dube","given":"Eve"},{"family":"Amsel","given":"Rhonda"},{"family":"Knauper","given":"Barbel"},{"family":"Naz","given":"Anila"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Samara"},{"family":"Rosberger","given":"Zeev"}],"citation-key":"shapiroVaccineHesitancyScale2018","container-title":"Vaccine","container-title-short":"Vaccine","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.043","ISSN":"0264-410X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,29]]},"language":"en","page":"660-667","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The vaccine hesitancy scale: Psychometric properties and validation","title-short":"The vaccine hesitancy scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17317966","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"shariffDoesReligionIncrease2015","abstract":"Religion affects both moral decision-making and moral behavior. Compared to the more utilitarian non-believers, religious believers tend to endorse a meta-ethics rooted in deontic rules and views of objective moral truths. Believers are also more likely to endorse authority, loyalty and purity as motives for moral concern. The moral importance of prosocial behavior, however, is endorsed across the religiosity spectrum. Religiosity is associated with higher self-reports, but not behavioral measures of prosocial behavior. This discrepancy can be explained on the one hand by a tendency for the religious to be higher in impression management and self-enhancement, and on the other hand by a failure of lab-based behavioral tasks to capture the real life circumstances under which religion inspires prosocial behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Shariff","given":"Azim F"}],"citation-key":"shariffDoesReligionIncrease2015","collection-title":"Morality and ethics","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.07.009","ISSN":"2352-250X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108-113","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Does religion increase moral behavior?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15001876","volume":"6"},

As the literature has grown, questions about the reliability and boundary conditions of religious priming have arisen. We use a combination of traditional effect-size analyses, p-curve analyses, and adjustments for publication bias to evaluate the robustness of four types of religious priming (Analyses 1-3), review the empirical evidence for religion’s effect specifically on prosocial behavior (Analyses 4-5), and test whether religious-priming effects generalize to individuals who report little or no religiosity (Analyses 6-7). Results across 93 studies and 11,653 participants show that religious priming has robust effects across a variety of outcome measures—prosocial measures included. Religious priming does not, however, reliably affect non-religious participants—suggesting that priming depends on the cognitive activation of culturally transmitted religious beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Shariff","given":"Azim F."},{"family":"Willard","given":"Aiyana K."},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"}],"citation-key":"shariffReligiousPrimingMetaAnalysis2016","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1177/1088868314568811","ISSN":"1088-8683, 1532-7957","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"language":"en","page":"27-48","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Religious Priming: A Meta-Analysis With a Focus on Prosociality","title-short":"Religious Priming","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868314568811","volume":"20"},

Consequently, in this article, we build upon a dual-process conceptualization of God representations, which is organized along 2 dimensions: (a) doctrinal representations (i.e., affect-light, 'head knowledge') versus experiential representations (i.e., affect-laden, 'heart knowledge'), and (b) explicit (i.e., conscious) versus implicit (i.e., nonconscious) representations. We use this conceptualization to critically review 73 existing measures of God representations, which are grouped into 4 categories: (a) self-report measures (n = 55; e.g., God description measures, relationally focused measures, and functionally focused measures), (b) performance-based measures (n = 7; e.g., stimulus-attribution measures and constructive measures), (c) structured interview measures (n = 4), and (d) implicit measures (n = 7). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure and make recommendations regarding their use by researchers and practitioners.

  {"id":"sharpReligiousDiversityScience2022","abstract":"Research shows that scientists tend to be less religious than the general population, and scientists’ religious affiliation and participation have declined over time (Ecklund & Park, 2009; Ecklund et al., 2008). Given the demographic differences between scientists and the general population, it was predicted that scientists who are religious would be regarded as having a counter-stereotypical combination of social identities. However, across five studies, we found that people’s own religious identities played a moderating role in the perception of a religious scientist. Although atheist participants perceived religious scientists as being more counter-stereotypical than atheist scientists, the same was not consistently found for nonreligious (but not atheist) or religious participants. These findings have important implications for debates around the underrepresentation of religious individuals in science. As religious individuals do not perceive these two identities to be incompatible, it may be stereotypes that others have about religious individuals and the culture of science more generally, rather than self-stereotypes, that are hurdles for religious individuals choosing a scientific career. Future research should take these findings into account and explore other potential barriers that lead to the underrepresentation of religious individuals within STEM fields.","author":[{"family":"Sharp","given":"Carissa A"},{"family":"Leicht","given":"Carola"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Zarzeczna","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Elsdon-Baker","given":"Fern"}],"citation-key":"sharpReligiousDiversityScience2022","container-title":"Group Processes","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430220987598","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"1836–1860","source":"Zotero","title":"Religious diversity in science: Stereotypical and counter-stereotypical social identities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1368430220987598","volume":"25"},

In Pakistan, this program was launched in 1978 with the main objectives of eradicating polio by 2012, eliminating measles and neonatal tetanus by 2015, and minimizing the incidence of other VPDs. However, despite the efforts of government and WHO, this program has not received the amount of success that was desired. Hence, the objectives of this study were to elucidate the main reasons behind not achieving the full immunization coverage in Pakistan, the awareness of children’s attendant about the importance of vaccination, their attitudes, thoughts and fears regarding childhood immunization, and the major hurdles faced in pursuit of getting their children vaccinated.\n\nMethods\nThis was an observational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study conducted during a one year period from 4th January, 2012 to 6th January, 2013 at the pediatric outpatient clinics of Civil Hospital (CHK) and National Institute of Child Health (NICH). We attempted to interview all the parents who could be approached during the period of the study. Thus, convenience sampling was employed. The parents were approached in the clinics and interviewed after seeking informed, written consent. Those patients who were not accompanied by either of their parents were excluded from the study. The study instrument comprised of three sections. The first section consisted was concerned with the demographics of the patient and the parents. The second section dealt with the reasons for complete vaccination or under-vaccination. The last section aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of the respondents.\n\nResults\nOut of 1044 patients, only 713(68.3%) were fully vaccinated, 239(22.9%) were partially vaccinated while 92(8.8%) had never been vaccinated. The vaccination status showed statistically significant association with ethnicity, income, residence, number of children and paternal occupation (p < 0.05 for all). The most common provocative factor for vaccination compliance was mass media (61.9%). The most common primary reason for non-vaccination was lack of knowledge (18.1%), whereas the most common secondary reason for non-vaccination was religious taboos (31.4%). Majority of the respondents demonstrated poor knowledge of EPI schedules or VPDs. However, most believed that there was a need for more active government/NGO involvement in this area.\n\nConclusion\nThe most common primary reason for non-vaccination, i.e. lack of knowledge, and the most common secondary reason, i.e. religious taboos, imply that there is dire need to promote awareness among the masses in collaboration with NGOs, and major religious and social organizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Asfandyar"},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Bushra"},{"family":"Ehtamam","given":"Anabia"},{"family":"Rahim","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Shaikh","given":"Hiba Arshad"},{"family":"Usmani","given":"Hina Azhar"},{"family":"Nasir","given":"Javeria"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Sheharbano"},{"family":"Zaki","given":"Muniba"},{"family":"Wahab","given":"Tooba Abdul"},{"family":"Wasim","given":"Warda"},{"family":"Aftab","given":"Ali Akber"}],"citation-key":"sheikhReasonsNonvaccinationPediatric2013","container-title":"Archives of Public Health","container-title-short":"Arch Public Health","DOI":"10.1186/0778-7367-71-19","ISSN":"0778-7367","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,13]]},"page":"19","PMCID":"PMC3716633","PMID":"23848348","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Reasons for non-vaccination in pediatric patients visiting tertiary care centers in a polio-prone country","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716633/","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"shenhavDivineIntuitionCognitive2012","abstract":"Some have argued that belief in God is intuitive, a natural (by-)product of the human mind given its cognitive structure and social context. If this is true, the extent to which one believes in God may be influenced by one’s more general tendency to rely on intuition versus reflection. Three studies support this hypothesis, linking intuitive cognitive style to belief in God. Study 1 showed that individual differences in cognitive style predict belief in God. Participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005), which employs math problems that, although easily solvable, have intuitively compelling incorrect answers. Participants who gave more intuitive answers on the CRT reported stronger belief in God. This effect was not mediated by education level, income, political orientation, or other demographic variables. Study 2 showed that the correlation between CRT scores and belief in God also holds when cognitive ability (IQ) and aspects of personality were controlled. Moreover, both studies demonstrated that intuitive CRT responses predicted the degree to which individuals reported having strengthened their belief in God since childhood, but not their familial religiosity during childhood, suggesting a causal relationship between cognitive style and change in belief over time. Study 3 revealed such a causal relationship over the short term: Experimentally inducing a mindset that favors intuition over reflection increases self-reported belief in God.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shenhav","given":"Amitai"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."}],"citation-key":"shenhavDivineIntuitionCognitive2012","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","DOI":"10.1037/a0025391","ISSN":"1939-2222, 0096-3445","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8]]},"language":"en","page":"423-428","publisher":"American Psychological Association","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Divine intuition: Cognitive style influences belief in God.","title-short":"Divine intuition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0025391","volume":"141"},

  {"id":"shermerViewScienceStephen2002","abstract":"Science historian Ronald Numbers once remarked that the two most influential historians of science of the 20th century were Thomas Kuhn and Stephen Jay Gould. All historians are deeply familiar with Kuhn's work and influence, and most know of the remarkable impact Gould has had on evolutionary theory through both his professional and popular works. But little attention has been paid to the depth, scope, and importance of Gould's rôle as historian and philosopher of science, and his use of popular science exposition to reinforce old knowledge and generate new. This paper presents the results of an extensive quantitative content analysis of Gould's 22 books, 101 book reviews, 479 scientific papers, and 300 Natural History essays, in terms of their subject matter (Evolutionary Theory, History and Philosophy of Science, Natural History, Paleontology/Geology, Social Science/Commentary), and thematic dichotomies (Theory-Data, Time's Arrow-Time's Cycle, Adaptationism-Nonadaptationism, Punctuationism-Gradualism, Contingency-Necessity). Special emphasis is placed on the interaction between the subjects and themata, how Gould has used the history of science to reinforce his evolutionary theory (and vice versa), and how his philosophy of science has influenced both his evolutionary theory and his historiography. That philosophy can best be summed up in a quotation from Charles Darwin, frequently cited by Gould: `All observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service'. Gould followed Darwin's advice throughout his career, including his extensive writings on the history and philosophy of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Shermer","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"shermerViewScienceStephen2002","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0306312702032004001","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"489-524","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The View of Science: Stephen Jay Gould as Historian of Science and Scientific Historian, Popular Scientist and Scientific Popularizer","title-short":"The View of Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312702032004001","volume":"32"},

The present study addressed this issue by comparing students' scientific beliefs with their supernatural beliefs along 4 dimensions of epistemic import: personal confidence, perceived consensus, means of justification, and openness to revision. Participants' scientific beliefs were strongly differentiated from their supernatural beliefs along the dimensions of confidence and consensus but only weakly differentiated along the dimensions of justification and revision, particularly for participants with (a) higher levels of supernatural belief and (b) lower levels of understanding of the nature of science. Moreover, participants' confidence in both types of beliefs was associated with their consensus estimates but not with their ability to cite evidence in support of, or potentially in conflict with, those beliefs.

In Study 1, college undergraduates (n = 100) verified scientific statements interspersed with images intended to prime either a scientific interpretation of the statements or an intuitive one. Participants primed with scientific images verified counterintuitive statements more accurately, but no more quickly, than those primed with intuitive images. In Study 2, college undergraduates (n = 138) received instruction that affirmed the scientific aspects of the target domain and refuted common misconceptions. Instruction increased the accuracy of participants’ responses to counterintuitive statements but not the speed of their responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that scientific interpretations of a domain can be prioritized over intuitive ones but the conflict between science and intuition cannot be eliminated altogether.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shtulman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Young","given":"Andrew G."}],"citation-key":"shtulmanTemperingTensionScience2024","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105680","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"105680","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tempering the tension between science and intuition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027723003141","volume":"243"},
  {"id":"shtulmanTensionsScienceIntuition2016","abstract":"The scientiﬁc knowledge needed to engage with policy issues like climate change, vaccination, and stem cell research often conﬂicts with our intuitive theories of the world. How resilient are our intuitive theories in the face of contradictory scientiﬁc knowledge? Here, we present evidence that intuitive theories in 10 domains of knowledge—astronomy, evolution, fractions, genetics, germs, matter, mechanics, physiology, thermodynamics, and waves—persist more than four decades beyond the acquisition of a mutually exclusive scientiﬁc theory. Participants (104 younger adults, Mage = 19.6, and 48 older adults, Mage = 65.1) were asked to verify two types of scientiﬁc statements as quickly as possible: those that are consistent with intuition (e.g., “the moon revolves around the Earth”) and those that involve the same conceptual relations but are inconsistent with intuition (e.g., “the Earth revolves around the sun”). Older adults were as accurate as younger adults at verifying both types of statements, but the lag in response times between intuition-consistent and intuition-inconsistent statements was signiﬁcantly larger for older adults than for younger adults. This lag persisted even among professional scientists. Overall, these results suggest that the scientiﬁc literacy needed to engage with topics of global importance may be constrained by patterns of reasoning that emerge in childhood but persist long thereafter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Shtulman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Harrington","given":"Kelsey"}],"citation-key":"shtulmanTensionsScienceIntuition2016","container-title":"Topics in Cognitive Science","container-title-short":"Top Cogn Sci","DOI":"10.1111/tops.12174","ISSN":"1756-8757, 1756-8765","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"en","page":"118-137","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tensions Between Science and Intuition Across the Lifespan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12174","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"shtulmanWhenCompetingExplanations2023","abstract":"Research from developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience reveals that people readily endorse multiple explanations of the same phenomena, even when those explanations are logically incompatible. This chapter will review evidence for the ubiquity of explanatory coexistence, with an eye toward the question of why people retain the first explanations they learn (folk explanations) even after learning more accurate ones (scientific explanations). The conflict between folk and scientific explanations is clearest in cases where the two provide incompatible accounts of the same phenomena, such as geocentric and heliocentric accounts of the day-night cycle, but cases of blatant incompatibility may be rare within the scope of everyday reasoning. This chapter examines several everyday phenomena in the domain of infectious disease made salient by the coronavirus pandemic— wearing masks, social distancing, sanitization, diagnostic testing, treatment, and vaccination—and shows how folk explanations of disease support many of the same practices and attitudes fostered by scientific explanations, albeit inaccurately and incompletely. This type of convergence may be a key reason why folk explanations survive the acquisition of scientific alternatives.","author":[{"family":"Shtulman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"shtulmanWhenCompetingExplanations2023","container-title":"Conjunctive Explanations","ISBN":"978-1-003-18432-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"number-of-pages":"23","publisher":"Routledge","title":"When Competing Explanations Converge: Coronavirus as a Case Study for Why Scientific Explanations Coexist With Folk Explanations","title-short":"When Competing Explanations Converge","type":"chapter"},

The reviewed literature suggests that trust in health agencies positively influenced people’s willingness to adopt recommended behavior. Most of these studies are atheoretical, and due to the lack of a common framework for trust and its antecedents, finding commonalities among the studies may seem difficult. The trust, confidence, and cooperation model was used to uncover the commonalities among the various studies on trust. This framework suggests that a distinction between values and past performance may be helpful to better understand the impact of trust on risk perception and behavior. Based on the reviewed literature, the following five recommendations relevant for crisis communication during pandemics were identified: A diverse set of experts should be used as communicators, medical personnel need to model the recommended behavior, a transparent information strategy should be used, the focus should be not only on trust but also on confidence, and establishing trust in health authorities before a pandemic occurs is important. Furthermore, research gaps were identified that should be addressed to better understand the role of trust when dealing with pandemics.

Despite this, the importance of trust has often been questioned. The relevant issue is not only whether trust is crucial but also the form of trust that people rely on in a given situation. In this review, I discuss various trust models and the relationship between trust and affect heuristics. I conclude that the importance of trust varies by hazard and respondent group. Most of the studies use surveys that provide limited information about causality. Future research should focus more on experiments that test whether trust is a consequence of people's attitudes or influences their attitudes toward a technology.

Findings from a unique archival data set (N = 619; all university faculty) and three preregistered experiments (N = 2,594) show that the perceived artistic-versus-scientific nature of the offender’s professional contributions influences the professional punishment received. In Study 1, analysis of four decades of university sexual-misconduct cases reveals that faculty in artistic (vs. scientific) fields have on average received more severe professional consequences. Study 2 demonstrates this experimentally, offering mediational evidence that greater difficulty morally decoupling art (vs. science) contributes to the phenomenon. Study 3 provides further evidence for this mechanism through experimental moderation. Finally, Study 4 shows that merely framing an individual’s work as artistic versus scientific results in replication of these effects.

  {"id":"sikimicEpistemicInclusionKey2023","abstract":"Throughout scientific history, there have been cases of mainstream science dismissing novel ideas of less prominent researchers. Nowadays, many researchers with different social and academic backgrounds, origins and gender identities work together on topics of crucial importance. Still, it is questionable whether the privileged groups consider the views of underprivileged colleagues with sufficient attention. To profit from the diversity of thoughts, the scientific community first has to be open to minority viewpoints and epistemically include them in mainstream research. Moreover, the idea of inclusive science poses stronger requirements than the paradigm of open science. We argue that the concept of integration of different opinions is insufficient because the process of integration assumes adjusting oneself to the majority view and fitting into the dominant paradigm while contributing only with smaller amendments. Epistemic inclusion, on the other hand, means dynamically changing the research paradigm during the interaction with diverse methods and hypotheses. The process of inclusion preserves marginalized views and increases epistemic justice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sikimić","given":"Vlasta"}],"citation-key":"sikimicEpistemicInclusionKey2023","container-title":"Social Epistemology","DOI":"10.1080/02691728.2023.2258831","ISSN":"0269-1728","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"page":"753-765","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Epistemic Inclusion as the Key to Benefiting from Cognitive Diversity in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2023.2258831","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"sikimicPoliticalAttitudesMatter2021","abstract":"The epistemic attitudes of scientists, such as epistemic tolerance and authoritarianism, play important roles in the discourse about rivaling theories. Epistemic tolerance stands for the mental attitude of an epistemic agent, e.g., a scientist, who is open to opposing views, while epistemic authoritarianism represents the tendency to uncritically accept views of authorities. Another relevant epistemic factor when it comes to the epistemic decisions of scientists is the skepticism towards the scientific method. However, the question is whether these epistemic attitudes are influenced by their sociopolitical counterparts, such as the researcher’s degree of conservatism. To empirically investigate the interplay between epistemic and sociopolitical attitudes of scientists, we conducted a survey with researchers (N = 655) across different disciplines. We propose scales for measuring epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism, as well as a scale for detecting the participants' readiness to question the scientific method. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism on the one hand, and career stage and sociopolitical views on the other hand. Interestingly, our study found only small correlations between the participants' degree of conservatism and their epistemic attitudes. This suggests that political views, against common argumentation, actually do not play an important role in one’s scientific decisions. Moreover, social scientists scored higher on the epistemic tolerance and lower on the epistemic authoritarianism scale than natural scientists. Finally, the results indicate that natural scientists question the scientific method less than social scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sikimić","given":"Vlasta"},{"family":"Nikitović","given":"Tijana"},{"family":"Vasić","given":"Miljan"},{"family":"Subotić","given":"Vanja"}],"citation-key":"sikimicPoliticalAttitudesMatter2021","container-title":"Review of Philosophy and Psychology","container-title-short":"Rev.Phil.Psych.","DOI":"10.1007/s13164-020-00504-7","ISSN":"1878-5166","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"775-801","source":"Springer Link","title":"Do Political Attitudes Matter for Epistemic Decisions of Scientists?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13164-020-00504-7","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"simisLureRationalityWhy2016","abstract":"Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists’ training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize “the public” and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists’ perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Simis","given":"Molly J."},{"family":"Madden","given":"Haley"},{"family":"Cacciatore","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Sara K."}],"citation-key":"simisLureRationalityWhy2016","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10/gfv8gg","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"400-414","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The lure of rationality: Why does the deficit model persist in science communication?","title-short":"The lure of rationality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662516629749","volume":"25"},

In the present research, we addressed how perceived science–atheism associations affect U.S. Christians’ attitudes toward science. In study 1, participants’ own estimates of atheists’ prevalence in science uniquely predicted distrust in science, and study 2 revealed a causal effect of perceived prevalence of atheists on distrust in science. Studies 3–4 (the latter preregistered) manipulated the concept of science–atheism associations more generally, revealing the same effects. These effects were mediated by the belief that scientists are anti-religion, not by moral distrust toward atheists or fundamentalist religious beliefs.

Yet we know relatively little about what makes people’s feelings about a given attitude object transform from a relatively nonmoral preference to a moral conviction. In this article, we review evidence from two experiments and a field study that sheds some light on the processes that lead to attitude moralization. This research explored the roles of incidental and integral affect, cognitive factors such as recognition of harm, and whether attitude-moralization processes can occur outside conscious awareness or require some level of conscious deliberation. The findings present some challenges to contemporary theories that emphasize the roles of intuition and harm and indicate that more research designed to better understand moralization processes is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Skitka","given":"Linda J."},{"family":"Wisneski","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Brandt","given":"Mark J."}],"citation-key":"skitkaAttitudeMoralizationProbably2018","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721417727861","ISSN":"0963-7214","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"9-13","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Attitude Moralization: Probably Not Intuitive or Rooted in Perceptions of Harm","title-short":"Attitude Moralization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417727861","volume":"27"},

We report on 19 studies (N = 12,284) that tested whether people’s perceptions that their attitudes are reflections of their moral and religious convictions across 30 different issues were functionally the same (the equivalence hypothesis) or different constructs (the distinct constructs hypothesis), and whether the relationship between these constructs was conditional on political orientation (the political asymmetry hypothesis). Seven of these studies (N = 5,561, and 22 issues) also had data that allowed us to test whether moral and religious conviction are only closely related for those who are more rather than less religious (the secularization hypothesis), and a narrower form of the political asymmetry and secularization hypotheses, that is, that people’s moral and religious convictions may be tightly connected constructs only for religious conservatives. Meta-analytic tests of each of these hypotheses yielded weak support for the secularization hypothesis, no support for the equivalence or political asymmetry hypotheses, and the strongest support for the distinct constructs hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Skitka","given":"Linda J."},{"family":"Hanson","given":"Brittany E."},{"family":"Washburn","given":"Anthony N."},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Allison B."}],"citation-key":"skitkaMoralReligiousConvictions2018","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0199311","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,21]]},"PMCID":"PMC6013213","PMID":"29927993","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Moral and religious convictions: Are they the same or different things?","title-short":"Moral and religious convictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6013213/","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"slomanWhenExplanationsCompete1994","abstract":"The likelihood of a statement is often derived by generating an explanation for it and evaluating the plausibility of the explanation. The explanation discounting principle states that people tend to focus on a single explanation; alternative explanations compete with the effect of reducing one another's credibility. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that this principle applies to inductive inferences concerning the properties of everyday categories. In both experiments, subjects estimated the probability of a series of statements (conclusions) and the conditional probabilities of those conclusions given other related facts. For example, given that most lawyers make good sales people, what is the probability that most psychologists make good sales people? The results showed that when the fact and the conclusion had the same explanation the fact increased people's willingness to believe the conclusion, but when they had different explanations the fact decreased the conclusion's credibility. This decrease is attributed to explanation discounting; the explanation for the fact had the effect of reducing the plausibility of the explanation for the conclusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sloman","given":"Steven A."}],"citation-key":"slomanWhenExplanationsCompete1994","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/0010-0277(94)90002-7","ISSN":"0010-0277","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-21","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"When explanations compete: the role of explanatory coherence on judgements of likelihood","title-short":"When explanations compete","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027794900027","volume":"52"},
  {"id":"slusherBeliefPerseveranceSelfDefeating1989","abstract":"At first glance, self-defeating behaviors predicated on honestly (but incorrectly) held beliefs would seem readily amenable to change. Surely in most cases, information is available to challenge these beliefs, set the record straight, and enhance the possibility of more adaptive behaviors. Yet both experience and research suggest that this optimistic appraisal is far too simplistic. The gap between information received and information perceived is filled with a surprising array of biases and errors which ultimately weaken the impact of new information on current beliefs. In this chapter, we explore ways in which beliefs persist in light of new information and in spite of the discrediting of old information. We see how people often are insensitive to information in the environment, yet ironically, they perceive evidence to support their beliefs where none actually exists. We examine how beliefs can take on a life of their own, no longer in need of the evidence that gave them birth. Throughout the chapter we relate these processes to such problems as depression and loneliness, problems in which the persistence of maladaptive beliefs plays an integral role. We also comment on how an understanding of these issues suggests ways in which incorrect beliefs and self-defeating behaviors may be overcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Slusher","given":"Morgan P."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Craig A."}],"citation-key":"slusherBeliefPerseveranceSelfDefeating1989","collection-title":"The Plenum Series in Social / Clinical Psychology","container-title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Experimental Research, Clinical Impressions, and Practical Implications","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4613-0783-9_2","editor":[{"family":"Curtis","given":"Rebecca C."}],"event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-4613-0783-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"language":"en","page":"11-40","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"Springer Link","title":"Belief Perseverance and Self-Defeating Behavior","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-0783-9_2"},

Dehumanization is a key feature of intergroup conflict, and many argue that belief in moralizing gods promotes a distinctly parochial altruism which excludes or even encourages conflict with non-believers. In six studies, five with American Christians and one with Israeli Jews (total N = 1,548), we find that belief in moralizing gods discourages dehumanization of ethno-religious outgroups. Across studies, participants completed measures of dehumanization from their own perspectives and also from the perspective of God, rating the groups’ humanity as they thought God would rate it or wish for them to rate it. When participants completed measures from both their own and God’s perspectives, they reported believing that, compared with their own views, God would see (or prefer for them to see) outgroup members as more human. Results demonstrate that religious believers attribute universalizing moral attitudes to God, compared to themselves, and document how belief in God can promote more positive intergroup attitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Julia Marianne"},{"family":"Pasek","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Vishkin","given":"Allon"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Kathryn A."},{"family":"Shackleford","given":"Crystal"},{"family":"Ginges","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"smithThinkingGodDiscourages2021","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/dvpn4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,31]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"Thinking about God Discourages Dehumanization of Religious Outgroups","type":"article","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/dvpn4/"},

This research explores whether undergraduates at a Christian university perceive and impose anti-Christian cultural stigma in science. Survey results from 126 biology students revealed that though students generally perceived the culture of science to be anti-Christian, they perceived Christians to have equal opportunities for scientific achievement. Results from a quasi-experimental audit study, in which students evaluated one of two profiles for mock prospective Ph.D. applicants (Christian or undisclosed faith) showed that students did not project anti-Christian stereotypes in terms of competence, hireability, or likeability, but showed some evidence of pro-Christian favorability. Together, this study suggests that the affirmational community of a Christian University may alleviate some negative impacts of anti-Christian stereotypes in academic biology, even as students perceive discrimination against Christians in science and atheists as more scientifically competent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Soneral","given":"Paula A.

In an effort to bring some clarity to questions of knowledge and belief embedded within science education research and teaching, we first describe the distinctions drawn between knowledge and belief in both philosophy and educational psychology, each of which have shaped the various definitions employed within science education. This discussion is followed by an examination of the distinctions drawn between knowledge and belief employed by three groups of science educators: the traditional distinctions of the foundationalists that are co-opted by researchers focusing on teacher thinking/cognition, the nonfoundational epistemology of the fallibilists and the evolution educators working from this framework, and the radical constructivists who react to and attempt to move past the limitations of these other positions. In this analysis, we explicate the different ways in which knowledge and belief are understood and operationalized in a broad spectrum of research, we describe the theoretical and philosophical assumptions underlying these approaches, and we explore the important areas of contention (both theoretical and empirical) surrounding each of these distinctions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Southerland","given":"Sherry A."},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Gale M."},{"family":"Matthews","given":"Michael R."}],"citation-key":"southerlandBeliefKnowledgeScience2001","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","ISSN":"1040-726X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"325-351","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Belief, Knowledge, and Science Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23363496","volume":"13"},

However, experimental and behavioral data and insights on this relationship and the underlying psychological processes are rare and often inconsistent. The present set of studies tests a model which proposes that institutional trust indirectly affects trust among unrelated strangers by enhancing individuals’ feelings of security. Study 1 (survey on trust in a broad spectrum of state institutions), Study 2 (nationally representative data from 16 countries), and Study 3 (experimental manipulation of institutional trust) provide convergent support for this hypothesis. Also, the results show that the effect remains consistent even after controlling for individual dispositions linked to interpersonal and institutional trust (Study 1 and 3) and country level indicators of institutional performance (Study 2). Taken together, these findings inform and contribute to the debate about the relationship between institutions and interpersonal trust by showing that when institutions are trusted, they increase feelings of security, and therefore promote interpersonal trust among strangers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Spadaro","given":"Giuliana"},{"family":"Gangl","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem Van"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Paul A.

Although the review primarily discusses recent research, its focus also invites reappraisal of some classic research in order to address basic questions about the scope and power of the group identity explanation. The self-categorization explanation of influence grounded in group norms, moderated by group identification, is compared and contrasted to other normative explanations of influence, notably the concept of injunctive norms and the relation to moral conviction. A range of moderating factors relating to individual variation, features of the intragroup and intergroup context, and important contextual variables (i.e., anonymity versus visibility, isolation versus copresence) that are particularly relevant to online influence in the new media are also reviewed.

Nonetheless, there is a great deal of variability in the strength and persistence of such beliefs, both across and within cultures. Here, we are interested in what underlying cognitive processes are associated with the phenomena of religious belief change. Although previous research has linked the tendency to engage in analytic thinking with religious dis-belief, this work has missed the potentially larger relationship between analytic thinking and belief change more broadly – that is change in any/either direction over time. Using a cross-sectional correlational study across two large datasets, including 16 countries and 50,827 individuals, we found that roughly 25 % of individuals indicated having substantively changing their beliefs at least once. Further, the relationship between analytic thinking and belief change appears independent from the association between analytic thinking and reported level of belief. Therefore, although analytic thinking is generally associated with a decrease in religious belief, we find some evidence that it may also support an increase in belief among those indicating past change. In total, this work provides evidence for a robust link between analytic thinking and religious belief change over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Stagnaro","given":"Michael Nicholas"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"stagnaroRoleAnalyticThinking2025","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2024.105989","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,1]]},"page":"105989","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the role of analytic thinking in religious belief change: Evidence from over 50,000 participants in 16 countries","title-short":"On the role of analytic thinking in religious belief change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027724002750","volume":"254"},

Half of the teachers reported encountering student religious-based opposition, in traditional/religious schools more than in secular ones. The teachers indicated that students’ religious faith may hinder their understanding of evolution, while teachers’ own perception of the conflict influenced their attitude. Most of the teachers indicated their willingness to relate to their students’ religious faith in class, mainly because of the importance of relating to students’ inner world. Our research adds to the global interest in evolution education by shedding light on this topic in a Jewish population, which has been little studied.

Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2-3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief-analytic cognitive style.","author":[{"family":"Ståhl","given":"Tomas"}],"citation-key":"stahlAmoralAtheistCross2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0246593","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3133094892","PMID":"33626046","title":"the amoral atheist a cross national examination of cultural motivational and cognitive antecedents of disbelief and their implications for morality","type":"article-journal"},

In the present research we adopt an individual difference approach, as we seek to identify psychological precursors of skepticism toward unfounded beliefs. We propose that part of the reason why unfounded beliefs are so widespread is because skepticism requires both sufficient analytic skills, and the motivation to form beliefs on rational grounds. In Study 1 we show that analytic thinking is associated with a lower inclination to believe various conspiracy theories, and paranormal phenomena, but only among individuals who strongly value epistemic rationality.

Data from cognitive science and cognitive psychology are discussed to show that the human information processing system can be defined as a highly flexible system. From this perspective, cognitive flexibility can be seen to some degree as normality and not as an exceptional case (Statement 1: Cognitive flexibility is normality not an exceptional case). Against this background, the idea of a generative nature of epistemological judgments is presented. This perspective provides possible (re-)interpretations of conceptual and methodological problems of research on epistemological beliefs (Statement 2: Stability is normality in educational psychology and cognitive flexibility is the exceptional case). To examine the value of this idea, a research philosophy is necessary that focuses on interactions instead of separate cognitive elements to understand the flexibility of the cognitive system.

We refer to this individual difference variable as moralized rationality. Eight studies are reported in which an instrument to measure individual differences in moralized rationality is validated. Results show that the Moralized Rationality Scale (MRS) is internally consistent, and captures something distinct from the personal importance people attach to being rational (Studies –). Furthermore, the MRS has high test-retest reliability (), is conceptually distinct from frequently used measures of individual differences in moral values, and it is negatively related to common beliefs that are not supported by scientific evidence (). We further demonstrate that the MRS predicts morally laden reactions, such as a desire for punishment, of people who rely on irrational (vs. rational) ways of forming and evaluating beliefs (Studies  and ). Finally, we show that the MRS uniquely predicts motivation to contribute to a charity that works to prevent the spread of irrational beliefs (). We conclude that (1) there are stable individual differences in the extent to which people moralize a reliance on rationality in the formation and evaluation of beliefs, (2) that these individual differences do not reduce to the personal importance attached to rationality, and (3) that individual differences in moralized rationality have important motivational and interpersonal consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ståhl","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Zaal","given":"Maarten P."},{"family":"Skitka","given":"Linda J."}],"citation-key":"stahlMoralizedRationalityRelying2016","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0166332","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,16]]},"page":"e0166332","PMCID":"PMC5112873","PMID":"27851777","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Moralized Rationality: Relying on Logic and Evidence in the Formation and Evaluation of Belief Can Be Seen as a Moral Issue","title-short":"Moralized Rationality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112873/","volume":"11"},

By believing that the world comprises objective facts about morality, a simple, rigid, and unambiguous structure is imposed on the moral landscape that is invariant to the whims and preferences of any particular person or group. Our results suggest that those more in need of personal structure and order in their lives are indeed more likely to endorse moral objectivism.

  {"id":"stanovichActivelyOpenMindedThinking2023","abstract":"Actively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by items that tap the willingness to consider alternative opinions, sensitivity to evidence contradictory to current beliefs, the willingness to postpone closure, and reflective thought. AOT scales are strong predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps such as superstitious thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. Nevertheless, AOT is most commonly measured with questionnaires rather than performance indicators. Questionnaire contamination becomes even more of a danger as the AOT concept is expanded into new areas such as the study of fake news, misinformation, ideology, and civic attitudes. We review our 25-year history of studying the AOT concept and developing our own AOT scale. We present a 13-item scale that both is brief and accommodates many previous criticisms and refinements. We include a discussion of why AOT scales are such good predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks. We conclude that it is because such scales tap important processes of cognitive decoupling and decontextualization that modernity increasingly requires. We conclude by discussing the paradox that although AOT scales are potent predictors of performance on most rational thinking tasks, they do not predict the avoidance of myside thinking, even though it is virtually the quintessence of the AOT concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanovich","given":"Keith E."},{"family":"Toplak","given":"Maggie E."}],"citation-key":"stanovichActivelyOpenMindedThinking2023","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","DOI":"10.3390/jintelligence11020027","ISSN":"2079-3200","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"27","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Actively Open-Minded Thinking and Its Measurement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/11/2/27","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"stanovichNaturalMysideBias2007","abstract":"Natural myside bias is the tendency to evaluate propositions from within one's own perspective when given no instructions or cues (such as within-participants conditions) to avoid doing so. We defined the participant's perspective as their previously existing status on four variables: their sex, whether they smoked, their alcohol consumption, and the strength of their religious beliefs. Participants then evaluated a contentious but ultimately factual proposition relevant to each of these demographic factors. Myside bias is defined between-participants as the mean difference in the evaluation of the proposition between groups with differing prior status on the variable. Whether an individual difference variable (such as cognitive ability) is related to the magnitude of the myside bias is indicated by whether the individual difference variable interacts with the between-participants status variable. In two experiments involving a total of over 1400 university students (n = 1484) and eight different comparisons, we found very little evidence that participants of higher cognitive ability displayed less natural myside bias. The degree of myside bias was also relatively independent of individual differences in thinking dispositions. We speculate that ideas from memetic theory and dual-process theory might help to explain why natural myside bias is quite dissociated from individual difference variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanovich","given":"Keith E."},{"family":"West","given":"Richard F."}],"citation-key":"stanovichNaturalMysideBias2007","container-title":"Thinking & Reasoning","DOI":"10.1080/13546780600780796","ISSN":"1354-6783","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8,1]]},"page":"225-247","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Natural myside bias is independent of cognitive ability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13546780600780796","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"stanovichNeedIntellectualDiversity2019","abstract":"Actively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by questionnaire items that tap the willingness to consider alternative opinions, the sensitivity to evidence contradictory to current beliefs, the willingness to postpone closure, and reflective thought. AOT has been found to be a strong predictor of performance on heuristics and biases tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps such as superstitious thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. Recently, several studies that have employed short forms of the AOT scale have shown startlingly high negative correlations with religiosity (in the range of −0.50 to −0.70). In a re-analysis of a large dataset, we demonstrate that it was a particular type of AOT item (termed a belief revision item, BR) that accounts for these large correlations. To our consternation, we realized that it was our research team that had introduced these items into the literature two decades ago, but we had heretofore never realized the potential for these items to skew correlations. In a new experiment, we demonstrate how BR items of this type disadvantage religiousminded subjects, and we show that it is possible to construct BR items with parallel content that are not so demographically biased. We also show that unbiased BR items do not sacrifice the predictive power that has previously been shown by AOT scales. We believe this lesson in item construction resulted from the lack of intellectual diversity in our own laboratory (specifically, the overwhelmingly secular composition of our lab personnel). We believe this case study shows the importance of intellectual diversity in psychology, especially when studying such topics as religiosity and political attitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanovich","given":"Keith E."},{"family":"Toplak","given":"Maggie E."}],"citation-key":"stanovichNeedIntellectualDiversity2019","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2019.03.006","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6]]},"language":"en","page":"156-166","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The need for intellectual diversity in psychological science: Our own studies of actively open-minded thinking as a case study","title-short":"The need for intellectual diversity in psychological science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027719300617","volume":"187"},

Drawing from literature on compensatory control, the present research fills this void by exploring the association between belief in scientific–technological progress and life satisfaction, investigating its underlying mechanism and examining cross-cultural moderators. The results showed that belief in scientific–technological progress is a stronger predictor of life satisfaction than religious beliefs in a nationally representative sample of the Dutch population (Study 1) and across 69 out of 72 countries (Study 2). Additional analyses highlighted the role of personal control beliefs as the mechanism driving this effect: a strong belief in scientific–technological progress was associated with an enhanced sense of personal control, which in turn contributed to higher life satisfaction. Consistent with previous research on “shared reality” and person–culture fit, the beneficial consequences of an individual's belief in scientific–technological progress were enhanced when this belief was widely held within a specific culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Stavrova","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Ehlebracht","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fetchenhauer","given":"Detlef"}],"citation-key":"stavrovaBeliefScientificTechnological2016","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2016.03.013","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"227-236","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Belief in scientific–technological progress and life satisfaction: The role of personal control","title-short":"Belief in scientific–technological progress and life satisfaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691630160X","volume":"96"},

This research contributes to this debate by showing that the nature of individuals' religious orientations and their relationships to prosociality depend on their country's social enforcement of religiosity. Our analyses of data from more than 70 countries indicate that in countries with no social pressure to follow a religion, religious individuals are more likely to endorse an intrinsic religious orientation (Study 1), engage in charity work (Study 2), disapprove of lying in their own interests (Study 3), and are less likely to engage in fraudulent behaviors (Study 4) compared with non-religious individuals. Ironically, in secular contexts, religious individuals are also more likely to condemn certain moral choices than non-religious individuals (Study 2).

We hypothesized that political conservatives with high AOT would be more likely than those with low AOT to acknowledge human-caused global warming. We predicted no such effect for liberals. Contrary to expectations, there was an unmoderated relationship between AOT and human causation belief.

One of the unique contributions of our data set is the ability to examine these trends by sex.

This latter finding constrains conclusions about the possible causal pathways between education, religiosity, and intelligence.

  {"id":"stolzCanStateAccelerate2020","abstract":"Germany was a divided country from 1949 until 1989. During this period, West Germany remained a rather religious country, while East Germany became, under socialist rule, one of the most secular regions in the world. We use this case of socialist state intervention as a natural experiment to test Voas' model of secular transition, which states that all Western and Central European countries follow the same path and speed of secularization. We employ ESS, GSS, and KMU surveys, as well as church statistics, to show that Voas' model holds for West Germany but not for the East. In East Germany, the state accelerated the secular transition substantially: through coercion, incentive structures, and education , it succeeded in triggering mass disaffiliations from the church irrespective of age, and in discouraging parents from socializing their children religiously. This led to a self-perpetuating process that resulted in a rapid increase in the number of people who were never socialized religiously at all.","author":[{"family":"Stolz","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Pollack","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"De Graaf","given":"Nan"}],"citation-key":"stolzCanStateAccelerate2020","container-title":"European Sociological Review","container-title-short":"European Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1093/esr/jcaa014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,30]]},"page":"626-642","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Can the State Accelerate the Secular Transition?

There is also a debate about the number of separate types of belief. Thereby, reported here is the development and validation of a new multidimensional questionnaire measure of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs in the general UK population.\nMethod & results\nIn Study 1, participants (N = 393) completed a questionnaire containing a pool of 82 items covering nine facets of belief discernible conceptually within the existing research literature. Scree analysis followed by exploratory factor analysis indicated the existence of four empirically observable factors: belief in supernatural forces; belief in God and destiny; belief in alien visitation, monsters and conspiracies; and belief in consciousness beyond the body. Twenty-four items were selected as measures of these factors. Studies 2, 3 and 4 demonstrated the convergent and divergent validity of the four empirically-derived questionnaire subscales and their internal reliability.\nConclusion\nThe resultant new Multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Scientifically Unsubstantiated Beliefs (MQSUB) is a psychometrically robust measure and comprises a comprehensive framework which can be used to systematically investigate the psychological and social concomitants of such beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Stone","given":"Anna"},{"family":"McDermott","given":"Mark R."},{"family":"Abdi","given":"Aisha"},{"family":"Cornwell","given":"Brittanie"},{"family":"Matyas","given":"Zsofia"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Ruby"},{"family":"Watt","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"stoneDevelopmentValidationMultidimensional2018","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.024","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"146-156","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Development and validation of the multi-dimensional questionnaire of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918300898","volume":"128"},
  {"id":"stonesStudentsPerceptionsReligion2020","abstract":"In England, both Religious Education (RE) and science are mandatory parts of the school curriculum throughout the 5-16 age range. Nevertheless, there remain concerns that, as in many countries, students do not have a good understanding about the scope of each subject nor about how the two subjects relate. This article reports on a study that involved an intervention of six lessons in RE and six in science that were intended to help 13-15 year-old students develop a better appreciation for the relationship(s) between science and religion and a less reductionist understanding of biology. Our focus here is on the understandings that students have about the relationship between science and religion. The intervention was successful in improving the understandings of almost half of the students interviewed, but in these interviews we still found many instances where students showed misunderstandings of the nature of both religious and scientific knowledge. We argue that RE needs to attend to questions regarding the nature of knowledge if students are to develop better understandings of the scope of religions and how they arrive at their knowledge claims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Stones","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Jo"},{"family":"Reiss","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Mujtaba","given":"Tamjid"}],"citation-key":"stonesStudentsPerceptionsReligion2020","container-title":"Religious Education","container-title-short":"Religious Education","DOI":"10.1080/00344087.2020.1769537","ISSN":"0034-4087, 1547-3201","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,26]]},"language":"en","page":"349-363","publisher":"Routledge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Students’ Perceptions of Religion and Science, and How They Relate: the Effects of a Classroom Intervention","title-short":"Students’ Perceptions of Religion and Science, and How They Relate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00344087.2020.1769537","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"streibAtheistsAgnosticsApostates2013","abstract":"In the scientific study of religion in general and the psychology of religion in particular, atheists and agnostics have received limited attention, whereas believers and converts have stood in the center of interest. More recently, however, more attention has been given to atheists and agnostics, and several researchers have recommended studying atheists and agnostics in their own right (Hood, Hill, & Spilka, 2009; Hunsberger & Altemeyer, 2006; Keysar, 2007; Kosmin & Keysar, 2007). This new interest may in part be due to indications of a considerable increase in the probability of religious nonaffiliation in the United States. According to one recent study, this probability has risen “from between .06 and .08 in the 1970s and 1980s to almost .16 in 2006” (Schwadel, 2010, p. 318). Although the question of who the “nones” are (cf. Pasquale, 2007) should be approached with care, these groups of unaffiliates and disaffiliates likely include a number of atheists and agnostics. Most of the research in this area takes a static and synchronic approach, contrasting belief versus unbelief or religiosity versus atheism or agnosticism. We believe that a more dynamic approach is called for, one that views atheism and agnosticism as processes. From the perspective of a dynamic approach, it is also necessary to include apostasy in this discussion, because people who leave their faith are in the process of a developmental change, a migration in the religious field that eventually may lead to exiting the religious domain altogether. Therefore, the three terms atheist, agnostic, and apostasy are interrelated and need to be studied together. For a deeper understanding of atheists, agnostics, and people who deconvert eventually to atheist and agnostic beliefs, it is imperative to know their motivations, the predictors of their stance toward religion, and the effects of their religious approach on various outcomes. There are a number of particularly interesting questions about outcomes: Are the shifts to atheism, agnosticism, and apostasy associated with an increase or a decrease in psychological well-being? How do these religious positions affect physical health? Do they lead to differences in preferences in the ways of coping with major life stressors? In this chapter, we address these questions, discuss the results from extant research, and suggest directions for future research.

Across five experiments, we demonstrate that moral traits—more than any other mental faculty—are considered the most essential part of identity, the self, and the soul. Memory, especially emotional and autobiographical memory, is also fairly important. Lower-level cognition and perception have the most tenuous connection to identity, rivaling that of purely physical traits.

Additionally, we show that societal consensus around trust in science moderates these individual-level and country-level relationships.

  {"id":"sundinRethinkingCommunicationIntegrating2018","abstract":"Storytelling is a two-way interaction, written or oral, between someone telling a story and one or more listeners. It is a well-known and powerful means of communicating messages and engaging audiences. In this commentary paper, we present a framework for the integration of storytelling in systematic reviews and systematic maps at the stages where stakeholders are actively involved. Using storytelling to explain complex research has, in the past, not been considered a rigorous method of communicating science. But an increasing number of studies are showing how narratives can be useful for developing trust with an audience and increasing knowledge retention as well as the ability and willingness by audiences to learn and take action. Being easily digested by the human brain, stories help bridging between our logos and pathos; when an audience becomes emotionally receptive of facts, chances increase that they will respond and act on the knowledge. Here, we argue that storytelling holds potential as a tool in systematic reviews and systematic maps, serving mainly two purposes. First, collecting contextual narratives from stakeholders at the stages of question formulation and protocol writing can help to inform and generate relevant research questions and review designs. Here, we refer to contextual narratives as stories gathered from stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective. Second, creating a final story that faithfully presents the review results, while also relating to the contextual narratives, can contribute to effective communication of the results to stakeholders as well as to a broader audience. This approach can increase their engagement with the science and the implementation of evidence-based decisions. The paper concludes that storytelling holds untapped potential for communicating evidence from systematic reviews and maps for increased stakeholder engagement. It is time for researchers and research networks such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to support and emphasize the importance of exploring new tools for effective science communication, such as storytelling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Sundin","given":"Anneli"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Karolin"},{"family":"Watt","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"sundinRethinkingCommunicationIntegrating2018","container-title":"Environmental Evidence","container-title-short":"Environ Evid","DOI":"10.1186/s13750-018-0116-4","ISSN":"2047-2382","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,19]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Springer Link","title":"Rethinking communication: integrating storytelling for increased stakeholder engagement in environmental evidence synthesis","title-short":"Rethinking communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-018-0116-4","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"sunsteinConspiracyTheories","abstract":"Many millions of people hold conspiracy theories; they believe that powerful people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important practice or some terrible event. A recent example is the belief, widespread in some parts of the world, that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out not by Al Qaeda, but by Israel or the United States. Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. Such theories typically spread as a result of identifiable cognitive blunders, operating in conjunction with informational and reputational influences. A distinctive feature of conspiracy theories is their self-sealing quality. Conspiracy theorists are not likely to be persuaded by an attempt to dispel their theories; they may even characterize that very attempt as further proof of the conspiracy. Because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a “crippled epistemology,” in accordance with which it is rational to hold such theories, the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups. Various policy dilemmas, such as the question whether it is better for government to rebut conspiracy theories or to ignore them, are explored in this light.","author":[{"family":"Sunstein","given":"Cass R"},{"family":"Vermeule","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"sunsteinConspiracyTheories","language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Conspiracy Theories","type":"article-journal"},

Although there is no marked ideological asymmetry in conspiracy belief, research indicates that conspiracy theories may play a powerful role in ideological processes. In particular, they are associated with ideological extremism, distrust of rival ideological camps, populist distrust of mainstream politics, and ideological grievances. The ‘conspiracy mindset’ characterizes the ideological significance of conspiracy belief, and is associated with measuring conspiracy belief by means of abstract propositions associated with aversion and distrust of powerful groups. We suggest that this approach does not pay sufficient attention to the nonrational character of specific conspiracy beliefs and thus runs the risk of mischaracterizing them, and mischaracterizing their ideological implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sutton","given":"Robbie M"},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Karen M"}],"citation-key":"suttonConspiracyTheoriesConspiracy2020","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2020.02.015","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"118-122","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Conspiracy theories and the conspiracy mindset: implications for political ideology","title-short":"Conspiracy theories and the conspiracy mindset","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300358","volume":"34"},

In addition, political identity differentially related to the two liberty subfoundations consistent with salient political party themes.

  {"id":"suyadiFiqhDisasterMitigation2020","abstract":"Fikih Kebencanaan (Coping with Disaster) is a product of Muhammadiyah's ijtihad to respond to contemporary problems, especially geological and non-geological disasters, which later become the normative foundation for the mitigation of health disasters such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The paradigm of the present research is a transdisciplinary qualitative type with a phenomenological approach. The research analyzed the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan and its actualization in Covid-19 mitigation, the medical health movement and the reconstruction of fiqh of worship during an emergency in particular, and how to deal with the disaster theologically in general. The results showed that the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan was expanded in terms of medical, theological, and educational movements. Medical movement is a health movement in the form of providing 74 Covid-19 Standby Hospitals capable of accommodating 3917 patients or 36.15% of the total number of cases in Indonesia, followed by the distribution of masks, gloves, and foods to 401,209 Covid-19 affected victims. The theological movement was in the form of religious provision in which Muhammadiyah attempted to reconstruct classical Islamic jurisprudence of the rule of worship to adapt to an emergency. In contrast, the Indonesian Council of Ulema (MUI) applied zoning. The educative movement was a preventive effort to counter narration stemming from micro-celebrity Da'i (Islamic preacher) & Influencers (religious preachers) tried to circumvent religious provisions with their viral statements on social media. This effort was realized by developing neuroscience Islamic education with learning media in visualization that combined modern comics and contemporary cartoons with cinematic narratives. The neuroscience Islamic education movement tried not to use the dogmatic-monolithic approach as in classical education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,16]]},"author":[{"literal":"Suyadi"},{"family":"Nuryana","given":"Zalik"},{"family":"Fauzi","given":"Niki Alma Febriana"}],"citation-key":"suyadiFiqhDisasterMitigation2020","container-title":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","container-title-short":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101848","ISSN":"2212-4209","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101848","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The fiqh of disaster: The mitigation of Covid-19 in the perspective of Islamic education-neuroscience","title-short":"The fiqh of disaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920313509","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"swamiAnalyticThinkingReduces2014","abstract":"Belief in conspiracy theories has been associated with a range of negative health, civic, and social outcomes, requiring reliable methods of reducing such belief. Thinking dispositions have been highlighted as one possible factor associated with belief in conspiracy theories, but actual relationships have only been infrequently studied. In Study 1, we examined associations between belief in conspiracy theories and a range of measures of thinking dispositions in a British sample (N = 990). Results indicated that a stronger belief in conspiracy theories was signiﬁcantly associated with lower analytic thinking and open-mindedness and greater intuitive thinking. In Studies 2–4, we examined the causational role played by analytic thinking in relation to conspiracist ideation. In Study 2 (N = 112), we showed that a verbal ﬂuency task that elicited analytic thinking reduced belief in conspiracy theories. In Study 3 (N = 189), we found that an alternative method of eliciting analytic thinking, which related to cognitive disﬂuency, was effective at reducing conspiracist ideation in a student sample. In Study 4, we replicated the results of Study 3 among a general population sample (N = 140) in relation to generic conspiracist ideation and belief in conspiracy theories about the July 7, 2005, bombings in London.

  {"id":"swamiSocialPsychologicalOrigins2012","abstract":"Two studies examined correlates of belief in a Jewish conspiracy theory among Malays in Malaysia, a culture in which state-directed conspiracism as a means of dealing with perceived external and internal threats is widespread. In Study 1, 368 participants from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, completed a novel measure of belief in a Jewish conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation, and anomie. Initial analysis showed that the novel scale factorially reduced to a single dimension. Further analysis showed that belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory was only signiﬁcantly associated with general conspiracist ideation, but the strength of the association was weak. In Study 2, 314 participants completed the measure of belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation, and ideological attitudes. Results showed that belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory was associated with anti-Israeli attitudes, modern racism directed at the Chinese, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation. General conspiracist ideation did not emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor once other variables had been accounted for. These results suggest that there may be speciﬁc cultural and social psychological forces that drive belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory within the Malaysian context. Speciﬁcally, belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory among Malaysian Malays appears to serve ideological needs and as a mask for anti-Chinese sentiment, which may in turn reafﬁrm their perceived ability to shape socio-political processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Swami","given":"Viren"}],"citation-key":"swamiSocialPsychologicalOrigins2012","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00280","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"280","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Psychological Origins of Conspiracy Theories: The Case of the Jewish Conspiracy Theory in Malaysia","title-short":"Social Psychological Origins of Conspiracy Theories","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00280/abstract","volume":"3"},

Disagreement reigns, however, regarding the nature of the mechanism that underlies such compensatory activity.

For example, research on self-verification has demonstrated that just as people with positive self-views react to negative evaluations by amplifying their efforts to confirm their positive self-views, people with negative self-views react to positive evaluations by amplifying their efforts to confirm negative self-views. Further, whereas past research on self-verification strivings demonstrate that coherence strivings motivate efforts to confirm negative as well as positive self-views, recent work on meaning maintenance activities indicates that people work to verify implicit as well as explicit self-views.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Swann","given":"William B."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"swannWhyThreatsTrigger2012","container-title":"Social Cognition","DOI":"10.1521/soco.2012.30.6.758","ISSN":"0278-016X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"page":"758-777","publisher":"Guilford Publications Inc.","source":"guilfordjournals.com (Atypon)","title":"Why Threats Trigger Compensatory Reactions: The Need for Coherence and Quest for Self-Verification","title-short":"Why Threats Trigger Compensatory Reactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/soco.2012.30.6.758","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"tabakSocioculturalExplorationEpistemological2008","abstract":"Recent research points to the centrality of epistemological knowledge in subject-matter learning and reasoning. However, our understanding of factors that might influence epistemological development is still fairly limited. In this chapter, we synthesize results from a series of cross-sectional studies in order to consider sociocultural perspectives of epistemological development, and the role that schooling, community, and culture play in this process. An overall sample of 390 Israeli adolescents completed an epistemological reasoning questionnaire, adapted from Kuhn et al. (2000), which assesses whether respondents hold absolutist, multiplist, or evaluativist positions concerning the truth-value of knowledge claims in values, social, and physical domains. Participants included secular Jewish 7th, 9th, and 11th graders, religious Jewish 7th graders, and Bedouin 7th and 9th graders. Thus, we were able to compare differences in epistemological positions across grade-level and cultural background. There were similar gradelevel differences in both groups, but the Bedouins had higher percentages of absolutists than the Jews in all domains, particularly in values. Grade-level changes across cultural groups suggest that schooling is a factor in changes in epistemological understanding. However, cultural differences suggest that cultural values and out-of-school interactions might also be a factor in epistemological understanding. Sociocultural theory provides a framework that can explain patterns that diverge from typical developmental models, and existing literature on the epistemological beliefs of particular cultural groups. The results might help explain why it has been difficult to find consistent age-related epistemological development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabak","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Weinstock","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"tabakSocioculturalExplorationEpistemological2008","container-title":"Knowing, Knowledge and Beliefs: Epistemological Studies across Diverse Cultures","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4020-6596-5_8","editor":[{"family":"Khine","given":"Myint Swe"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-1-4020-6596-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"177-195","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Sociocultural Exploration of Epistemological Beliefs","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-6596-5_8"},

Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, finding strong evidence of a prior attitude effect such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments. When reading pro and con arguments, participants (Ps) counterargue the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias. We also find a confirmation bias—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read. Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization—the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors and highest levels of political sophistication.

Americans (n = 474) were randomly assigned to an experimental condition in which COVID-19 was framed as an existential threat to the United States or a non-existential threat control condition. They then completed self-report measures of anxious arousal and blatant prejudice towards Chinese people. As expected, participants in the threat (vs. control) condition reported greater anxious arousal which, in turn, predicted greater blatant prejudice. Threat (vs. control) condition also indirectly predicted greater prejudice via greater anxious arousal. Results suggest that COVID-19 existential threat may diminish social capital, which would further degrade people’s health and well-being.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabri","given":"Nassim"},{"family":"Hollingshead","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Wohl","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"tabriFramingCOVID19Existential2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/mpbtr","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,31]]},"language":"en-us","publisher":"OSF","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"Framing COVID-19 as an Existential Threat Predicts Anxious Arousal and Prejudice towards Chinese People","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/mpbtr"},

This paper explores the ways in which the religion/science relationship is reflected in people’s mind. Our proposed typology of positions suggests that people can be generally categorized as “religious salient,” “scientific salient,” “contextual salient,” or “anomic salient.” A religious orientation scale and a scientific orientation scale have been composed to test the proposed typology. Based on the results of self-identifications by respondents with these categories as well as the observed scores by respondents on the two scales, we conclude that the suggested typology is supported by empirical evidence.

Often these inferences are made on the basis of data from randomized experiments that use one of two paradigmatic designs: Outcome Switching, in which identical methods are described as reaching politically congenial versus uncongenial conclusions; or Party Cues, in which identical information is described as being endorsed by politically congenial versus uncongenial sources. Here we argue that these designs often undermine causal inferences of politically motivated reasoning because treatment assignment violates the excludability assumption. Specifically, assignment to treatment alters variables alongside political motivation that affect reasoning outcomes, rendering the designs confounded. We conclude that distinguishing politically motivated reasoning from these confounds is important both for scientific understanding and for developing effective interventions; and we highlight those designs better placed to causally identify politically motivated reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Tappin","given":"Ben M"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G"}],"citation-key":"tappinThinkingClearlyCausal2020","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2020.01.003","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"81-87","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Thinking clearly about causal inferences of politically motivated reasoning: why paradigmatic study designs often undermine causal inference","title-short":"Thinking clearly about causal inferences of politically motivated reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300036","volume":"34"},

The interview responses were evaluated both within the frame of the Islamization of science and Ian Barbour’s (When science meets religion: enemies, strangers, or partners?, Harper, San Francisco, 2000) classification, which is based on four categories; conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration. Interviews were semi-structured and the data analyzed using a framework of typological and interpretive approaches (Hatch in Doing qualitative research in education settings, State University of New York Press, New York, 2002). The interview findings show that Barbour’s classification is a useful tool for categorizing perceptions. However, these perceptions may fall into more than one category. A surprising side effect was the misinterpretation and misuse of constructivism as well as the notion of a scientific theory as ways to negate the theory of evolution, and promote the teaching of intelligent design. These misinterpretations and misuses occur because there is the belief that the interaction between science and religion in daily life is considered part of the cultural setting in Islamic countries, which is what students bring to the table, as well as the notion that reality can only be found in the Qur’an.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Taşkın","given":"Özgür"}],"citation-key":"taskinExploratoryExaminationIslamic2014","container-title":"Cultural Studies of Science Education","container-title-short":"Cult Stud of Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11422-013-9553-0","ISSN":"1871-1510","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"855-875","source":"Springer Link","title":"An exploratory examination of Islamic values in science education: Islamization of science teaching and learning via constructivism","title-short":"An exploratory examination of Islamic values in science education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11422-013-9553-0","volume":"9"},

We review recent social-psychological research on moral motivation, concluding that moralization is a double-edged sword: It provides people with a powerful motivation to act for a cause they believe in, yet people often cope with moral threats in defensive ways. Fortunately, recent research also hints at possible solutions of this dilemma of communication. One solution involves the non-moral framing of persuasive messages as a means to avoid defensive responses. Another solution revolves around promoting coping mechanisms that do not reflect defensiveness, such as the promotion of value-driven group identities and the development of moral convictions that increase a sense of agency. Finally, we suggest ways to developing change-oriented moral convictions about climate issues. Our findings are of substantial relevance for scientists and policy makers who aim at stimulating behavioural change (e.g., governments’ commitment to the reduction of GHG emissions).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Täuber","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Zomeren","given":"Martijn","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Kutlaca","given":"Maja"}],"citation-key":"tauberShouldMoralCore2015","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-014-1200-6","ISSN":"1573-1480","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"453-464","source":"Springer Link","title":"Should the moral core of climate issues be emphasized or downplayed in public discourse?

  {"id":"tayEstablishingConstructContinua2018","abstract":"Many areas of psychological science rely heavily on theoretical constructs, such as personality traits, attitudes, and emotions, and many of these measured constructs are defined by a continuum that represents the different degrees of the attribute. However, these continua are not usually considered by psychologists during the process of scale development and validation. Unfortunately, this can lead to numerous scientific problems, such as incomplete measurement of the construct, difficulties in distinguishing between constructs, and compromised evidence for validity. The purpose of the current article is to propose an approach for carefully considering these issues in psychological measurement. This approach, which we term continuum specification, is a two-stage process in which the researcher defines and then properly operationalizes the target continuum. Defining the continuum involves specifying its polarity (i.e., the meaning of its poles, or ends) and the nature of its gradations (i.e., the quality that separates high from low scores). Operationalizing the continuum means using this definition to develop a measure that (a) sufficiently captures the entire continuum, (b) has appropriate response options, (c) uses correct procedures for assessing dimensionality, and (d) accounts for the underlying response process. These issues have significant implications for psychological measurement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tay","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Jebb","given":"Andrew T."}],"citation-key":"tayEstablishingConstructContinua2018","container-title":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","DOI":"10/gfsm82","ISSN":"2515-2459, 2515-2467","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"375-388","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Establishing Construct Continua in Construct Validation: The Process of Continuum Specification","title-short":"Establishing Construct Continua in Construct Validation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918775707","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"thagardExplanatoryCoherence1989","abstract":"This target article presents a new computational theory of explanatory coherence that applies to the acceptance and rejection of scientific hypotheses as well as to reasoning in everyday life. The theory consists of seven principles that establish relations of local coherence between a hypothesis and other propositions. A hypothesis coheres with propositions that it explains, or that explain it, or that participate with it in explaining other propositions, or that offer analogous explanations. Propositions are incoherent with each other if they are contradictory. Propositions that describe the results of observation have a degree of acceptability on their own. An explanatory hypothesis is accepted if it coheres better overall than its competitors. The power of the seven principles is shown by their implementation in a connectionist program called ECHO, which treats hypothesis evaluation as a constraint satisfaction problem. Inputs about the explanatory relations are used to create a network of units representing propositions, while coherence and incoherence relations are encoded by excitatory and inhibitory links. ECHO provides an algorithm for smoothly integrating theory evaluation based on considerations of explanatory breadth, simplicity, and analogy. It has been applied to such important scientific cases as Lavoisier's argument for oxygen against the phlogiston theory and Darwin's argument for evolution against creationism, and also to cases of legal reasoning. The theory of explanatory coherence has implications for artificial intelligence, psychology, and philosophy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Thagard","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"thagardExplanatoryCoherence1989","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X00057046","ISSN":"1469-1825, 0140-525X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",9]]},"language":"en","page":"435-467","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Explanatory coherence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/explanatory-coherence/E05CB61CD64C26138E794BC601CC9D7A","volume":"12"},

One possibility is that differences in social conformity (i.e. the tendency to think and behave as others do) underlie inclination towards religiosity. However, the link between religiosity and conformity has not yet been directly examined. In this study, we tested the notion that non-religious individuals show dampened social conformity, using both self-reported and neural (EEG-based ERPs) measures of sensitivity to others’ influence. Non-religious vs religious undergraduate subjects completed an experimental task that assessed levels of conformity in a domain unrelated to religion (i.e. in judgments of facial attractiveness). Findings showed that, although both groups yielded to conformity pressures at the self-report level, non-religious individuals did not yield to such pressures in their neural responses.

Each of thesecategories can also be isolated from the sense inwhich biotechnology raises religious or metaphysicalissues. Moral purification yields a comprehensive andsystematic account of normative issues raised bycontroversial science. Hybridization proceeds bytaking concern for all these elements to be a mark ofsound moral character. The advocate of hybridizationinfers that those who employ a strategy ofpurification seek to avoid accountability by dividingissues, and hence are not to be trusted. Lack of trustincreases perceived risk and challenges the legitimacyof government regulations to control social,environmental, and human health risks that areestablished under separate mandate, and administeredby separate agencies.The close alignment between government agencies, theiracademic affines, and the categories of purificationplaces the purified analysis in a favored politicalposition. Legitimation of science-based policy inareas like animal biotechnology becomes problematicbecause the concern of those who would take a hybridapproach (arguably the majority of lay persons) tounderstanding controversial science are excluded.Ironically, this exclusion heightens the perception ofrisk from animal biotechnology. The paper concludeswith a call for procedural approaches to incorporatingthe hybrid view of science‘s moral significance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Paul B."}],"citation-key":"thompsonSciencePolicyMoral1997","container-title":"Agriculture and Human Values","container-title-short":"Agriculture and Human Values","DOI":"10.1023/A:1007397315714","ISSN":"1572-8366","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"11-27","source":"Springer Link","title":"Science policy and moral purity: The case of animal biotechnology","title-short":"Science policy and moral purity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007397315714","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"thomsonInvestigatingAlternateForm2016a","abstract":"Much research in cognitive psychology has focused on the tendency to conserve limited cognitive resources. The CRT is the predominant measure of such miserly information processing, and also predicts a number of frequently studied decisionmaking traits (such as belief bias and need for cognition). However, many subjects from common subject populations have already been exposed to the questions, which might add considerable noise to data. Moreover, the CRT has been shown to be confounded with numeracy. To increase the pool of available questions and to try to address numeracy confounds, we developed and tested the CRT-2. CRT-2 questions appear to rely less on numeracy than the original CRT but appear to measure closely related constructs in other respects. Crucially, substantially fewer subjects from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk have been previously exposed to CRT-2 questions. Though our primary purpose was investigating the CRT-2, we also found that belief bias questions appear suitable as an additional source of new items. Implications and remaining measurement challenges are discussed.

  {"id":"tietjenReligiousZealAffective2021","abstract":"What kind of affective phenomenon is religious zeal and how does it relate to other affective phenomena, such as moral anger, hatred, and love? In this paper, I argue that religious zeal can be both, and be presented and interpreted as both, a love-like passion and an anger-like emotion. As a passion, religious zeal consists of the loving devotion to a transcendent religious object or idea such as God. It is a relatively enduring attachment that is constitutive of who the zealot is, and it expresses itself in a distinctive set of mental and behavioral dispositions. Most importantly, it motivates uncompromising actions and involves intense, hot, and deep emotions. As an anger-like emotion, religious zeal is an occurrent affective state of mind that is intentionally directed towards a specific (immanent) object, characteristically a person or group of persons. It condemns the violation of a religious norm that is taken to be of absolute validity and general applicability. It motivates an action aiming at vengeance and retaliation, and it involves intense and hot feelings of hostility towards its object. I argue that rather than reducing the complex phenomenon of religious zeal to one of these two manifestations, we should reflect upon the question of how the two distinct conceptualizations relate to each other (and are interwoven with political interests).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Tietjen","given":"Ruth Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"tietjenReligiousZealAffective2021","container-title":"Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences","container-title-short":"Phenom Cogn Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s11097-020-09664-4","ISSN":"1572-8676","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"75-91","source":"Springer Link","title":"Religious zeal as an affective phenomenon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-020-09664-4","volume":"20"},

Research indicates that some hesitant parents’ mistrust extends to specific conspiracy ideation, but research on vaccine conspiracy beliefs is still scarce. Our objective was to explore factors contributing to parental vaccine conspiracy beliefs and actual vaccine uptake in children. Design: A cross-sectional correlational design with a non-probabilistic sample of 823 volunteer participants surveyed online. Main outcome measures: We focussed on the contributions of the analytically rational and experientially intuitive thinking styles, as well as measures of emotional functioning, namely optimism and emotions towards vaccination, to vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine uptake as outcomes.\nResults: The obtained results showed that greater vaccine conspiracy beliefs were associated with stronger unpleasant emotions towards vaccination and greater experientially intuitive thinking, as well as lower levels of education. Furthermore, unpleasant emotions towards vaccination and intuitive thinking were associated with vaccine refusal.\nConclusion: These findings confirm the primary importance of emotions, along with the propensity towards intuitive thinking, in the context of vaccine conspiracy beliefs and refusal, supporting the notion that parents’ avoidance is guided by their affect. These results have direct implications for addressing vaccine hesitancy within public campaigns and policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomljenovic","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Bubic","given":"Andreja"},{"family":"Erceg","given":"Nikola"}],"citation-key":"tomljenovicItJustDoesnt2019","container-title":"Psychology & Health","container-title-short":"Psychology & Health","DOI":"10.1080/08870446.2019.1673894","ISSN":"0887-0446, 1476-8321","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,7]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","PMID":"31588791","publisher":"Routledge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"<i>It just doesn’t feel right</i> – the relevance of emotions and intuition for parental vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccination uptake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2019.1673894"},
  {"id":"tongRoleEpistemicSocial2020","abstract":"Over the last 15 years, researchers have been increasingly interested in understanding the nature and development of children’s selective trust. Three meta-analyses were conducted on a total of 51 unique studies (88 experiments) to provide a quantitative overview of 3- to 6-year-old children’s selective trust in an informant based on the informant’s epistemic or social characteristics, and to examine the relation between age and children’s selective trust decisions. The first and second meta-analyses found that children displayed medium-to-large pooled effects in favor of trusting the informant who was knowledgeable or the informant with positive social characteristics. Moderator analyses revealed that 4-year-olds were more likely to endorse knowledgeable informants than 3-year-olds. The third meta-analysis examined cases where two informants simultaneously differed in their epistemic and social characteristics. The results revealed that 3-year-old children did not selectively endorse informants who were more knowledgeable but had negative social characteristics over informants who were less knowledgeable but had positive social characteristics. However, 4- to 6-year-olds consistently prioritized epistemic cues over social characteristics when deciding who to trust. Together, these meta-analyses suggest that epistemic and social characteristics are both valuable to children when they evaluate the reliability of informants. Moreover, with age, children place greater value on epistemic characteristics when deciding whether to endorse an informant’s testimony. Implications for the development of epistemic trust and the design of studies of children’s selective trust are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tong","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Fuxing"},{"family":"Danovitch","given":"Judith"}],"citation-key":"tongRoleEpistemicSocial2020","container-title":"Developmental Science","DOI":"10.1111/desc.12895","ISSN":"1467-7687","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"e12895","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The role of epistemic and social characteristics in children’s selective trust: Three meta-analyses","title-short":"The role of epistemic and social characteristics in children’s selective trust","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/desc.12895","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"toscanelliReligiousnessWorldwideTranslation2022","abstract":"Religiousness and spirituality are important in the study of psychology for several reasons: They are central to identity and values; they have been reported as being positively associated with health and well-being; and they capture (and perhaps lead to) the largest measurable psychological differences between societies. At five items, the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL) is an efficient measure, which advantageously distinguishes between religious sentiment and activity, and between formal versus private involvement. This project extends its internal validation throughout the world, with formal tests of measurement invariance in three languages in Namibia (Study 1) and in a global sample of 26 countries (Study 2). Results confirmed a two-subscale factorial structure of Religious Activity (combining organizational and non-organizational activities) and Intrinsic Religiosity in Namibia and in half of the 26-country samples. In 13 other countries, fit was best for a one-factor model. Fit was problematic where there was too little intra-national variance: in China and Japan, where religious involvement is universally low, and in Tanzania, where it is universally high. Scalar measurement invariance was found for the one-factor structure across 13 samples and for the two-factor structure across 11 samples. External validation of the scale is examined using psychological and sociodemographic variables. This validation of the DUREL supports its use across contexts, facilitating increased attention to this important aspect of both personality and culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Toscanelli","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Shino","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Thalmayer","given":"Amber Gayle"}],"citation-key":"toscanelliReligiousnessWorldwideTranslation2022","container-title":"Measurement Instruments for the Social Sciences","container-title-short":"Measurement Instruments for the Social Sciences","DOI":"10.1186/s42409-022-00041-2","ISSN":"2523-8930","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,10]]},"page":"13","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Religiousness worldwide: translation of the Duke University Religion Index into 20 languages and validation across 27 nations","title-short":"Religiousness worldwide","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s42409-022-00041-2","volume":"4"},

As a result, we noticed that the production of meaning in terms of social sustainability was simultaneously anchored in the accumulation of four contextual “social worlds”: (a) that of social transformation induced by mediatization, (b) that of the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis that is neither social, economic, or environmental, but with consequences on the three levels of reality mentioned above, (c) that of spirituality during the time of the great monotheistic religious feasts and (d) that of the national culture of Romania, statistically the most religious country of the European Union.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Tudor","given":"Mihaela Alexandra"},{"family":"Filimon Benea","given":"Anamaria"},{"family":"Bratosin","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"tudorCOVID19PandemicLockdown2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph18052287","ISSN":"1661-7827","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,25]]},"page":"2287","PMCID":"PMC7967677","PMID":"33669049","source":"PubMed Central","title":"COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown and Religious Mediatization of Social Sustainability: A Case Study of Romania","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967677/","volume":"18"},

Both the values that scientists hold and their social context can affect scientific communication. Philosophers of science have recently begun studying scientific communication, especially as it relates to public policy. Some have proposed “guiding principles for communicating scientific findings” to promote trust and objectivity. This paper contributes to this line of research in a novel way using behavioural experimentation. We report results from three experiments testing judgments about the trustworthiness, competence and objectivity of scientists. More specifically, we tested whether such judgments are affected by three factors: consulting or not consulting nonscientists, conducting research under a restrictive or non-restrictive governmental communication policy, and the source of a lab’s funding. We found that each of these factors affects ordinary judgments of trustworthiness, competence and objectivity.

As predicted, when making evaluations of authorities, those lower in their power-distance values placed more weight on the quality of their treatment by authorities. In contrast, those with higher power-distance values focused more strongly on the favorability of their outcomes. These findings suggest that the degree to which authorities can gain acceptance for themselves and their decisions through providing dignified, respectful treatment is influenced by the cultural values of the disputants.

Drawing on secularization and post-secular theories, we develop and test several hypotheses about the relationships among exposure to scientific knowledge, perspectives on religion and science, and religious commitment using panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion. Our findings indicate that religious faith is strongest among young adults who: (1) accommodate scientific knowledge into their religious perspective, or (2) reject scientific knowledge that directly contradicts their religious beliefs about the origins of the world. Young adults are also more likely to have lower religious commitment when they view science and religion as independent institutions, lending support to secularization ideas about how social differentiation secularizes individuals. We further find that mere exposure to scientific knowledge, in terms of majoring in biology or acknowledging conflict between the teachings of religion and science, is usually not sufficient to undermine religious commitment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Uecker","given":"Jeremy E."},{"family":"Longest","given":"Kyle C."}],"citation-key":"ueckerExposureSciencePerspectives2017","container-title":"Social Science Research","container-title-short":"Social Science Research","DOI":"10/gbkrsc","ISSN":"0049-089X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"145-162","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Exposure to science, perspectives on science and religion, and religious commitment in young adulthood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16303635","volume":"65"},
  {"id":"ueckerProtestantClergyCulture2011","abstract":"Examinations of culture wars typically assess the attitudes of the American public. This study instead focuses on culture wars among religious elites—clergy—and tests three aspects of the culture wars thesis: (1) whether religious elites are engaged in culture wars, (2) whether clergy attitudes are polarized on these issues, and (3) whether religious authority or religious affiliation is more salient in creating culture wars cleavages. Using data from a large random sample of Protestant clergy, we find a substantial amount of engagement in culture wars by all types of Protestant clergy. The amount of polarization is more attributable to views of religious authority (i.e., biblical inerrancy) than to religious tradition. Moreover, polarization among clergy is somewhat more evident on culture wars issues than on other social and political issues. These findings are generally supportive of the culture wars thesis and should help return examinations of culture wars back to where they were originally theorized to be waged: among elites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Uecker","given":"Jeremy E."},{"family":"Lucke","given":"Glenn"}],"citation-key":"ueckerProtestantClergyCulture2011","container-title":"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01601.x","ISSN":"1468-5906","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion","page":"692-706","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Protestant Clergy and the Culture Wars: An Empirical Test of Hunter's Thesis","title-short":"Protestant Clergy and the Culture Wars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01601.x","volume":"50"},

However, little scholarly research has been carried out to explore this phenomenon. We present results from a national survey of 6020 individuals to give a comprehensive picture of contemporary public attitudes to evolution in Britain. Furthermore, we explore the effects of religion and education on attitudes to evolution. Unique to this study, we analyse the effects of attending a religiously affiliated school (‘faith school’) on acceptance of evolutionary theory. We examine these effects in the general population, and additionally, across different Christian, Muslim and Non-Religious subpopulations. Results give strong evidence that the number of creationists has been overstated previously. We find the effect of education is complex and varies between different religious groups, but that faith school attendance is associated with more acceptance of evolution for people belonging to groups that tend to reject it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Unsworth","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Voas","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"unsworthAttitudesEvolutionChristians2018","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662517735430","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"76-93","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Attitudes to evolution among Christians, Muslims and the Non-Religious in Britain: Differential effects of religious and educational factors","title-short":"Attitudes to evolution among Christians, Muslims and the Non-Religious in Britain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662517735430","volume":"27"},

In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain’s best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Unsworth","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Voas","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"unsworthDawkinsEffectCelebrity2021","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662521989513","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"434-454","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Dawkins effect?

  {"id":"upenieksTrustGodScience2021","abstract":"At present, COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the USA, but large proportions of the American populace remain unvaccinated. One possible source of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a lack of trust in science. In this study, drawing from the large literature at the intersection of science and religion, we ask whether beliefs in an engaged God (the belief that God is involved in daily human affairs) predict mistrust of the COVID-19 vaccine and whether any observed association differs across race, gender, and education. Using nationally representative data from Wave 6 of the Baylor Religion Survey (2021), our results suggest that beliefs in an engaged God were associated with greater mistrust in the COVID-19 vaccine. This association was amplified for Hispanic and lower educated Americans. We argue that beliefs in an engaged God may promote a distrust of science, reduce motivation to get vaccinated, and derive comfort and strength by placing control over one’s life in the hands of a loving, involved deity. We also situate our findings within an emerging body of work on the “dark side” of religion and reflect on their implications for understanding the broader religion/health connection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Upenieks","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Ford-Robertson","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"James E."}],"citation-key":"upenieksTrustGodScience2021","container-title":"Journal of Religion and Health","container-title-short":"J Relig Health","DOI":"10.1007/s10943-021-01466-5","ISSN":"1573-6571","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,29]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Trust in God and/or Science?

We examined intraindividual differences in epistemic beliefs about the natural, mathematical, social, and linguistic sciences that represented almost the entire spectrum of subjects taught in secondary schools. The sample comprised 196 pre-service teachers who four times filled in an epistemic belief questionnaire, which could capture four dimensions of epistemic beliefs in four school subject domains with sufficient reliability. Regarding the core question of domain specificity of epistemic beliefs, all four domains were found to largely differ from each other on all four epistemic dimensions. These findings were supported by correlational analyses and structural equation modelling. In total, they provide strong evidence for the domain specificity of epistemic beliefs about school subject domains, which raises the demand for a classification system to specify major fields of personal epistemology.HIGHLIGHTSWe examined pre-service teachers’ epistemic beliefs about school subject domains.We compared beliefs about the natural, mathematical, social, and linguistic sciences.A questionnaire with four dimensions reliably measured beliefs across domains.All four domains largely differed from each other in all four dimensions.Results provide strong evidence for the domain-specificity of epistemic beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Urhahne","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"Kremer","given":"Kerstin"}],"citation-key":"urhahneSpecificityEpistemicBeliefs2023","container-title":"Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/01443410.2023.2179605","ISSN":"0144-3410","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,20]]},"page":"1-20","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Specificity of epistemic beliefs across school subject domains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2023.2179605","volume":"0"},

While researchers have identified numerous psychological and political characteristics associated with conspiracy theory beliefs, the generalizability of those findings is uncertain because they are typically drawn from studies of only a few conspiracy theories. Here, we employ a national survey of 2021 U.S. adults that asks about 15 psychological and political characteristics as well as beliefs in 39 different conspiracy theories. Across 585 relationships examined within both bivariate (correlations) and multivariate (regression) frameworks, we find that psychological traits (e.g., dark triad) and non-partisan/ideological political worldviews (e.g., populism, support for violence) are most strongly related to individual conspiracy theory beliefs, regardless of the belief under consideration, while other previously identified correlates (e.g., partisanship, ideological extremity) are inconsistently related. We also find that the correlates of specific conspiracy theory beliefs mirror those of conspiracy thinking (the predisposition), indicating that this predisposition operates like an ‘average’ of individual conspiracy theory beliefs. Overall, our findings detail the psychological and political traits of the individuals most drawn to conspiracy theories and have important implications for scholars and practitioners seeking to prevent or reduce the impact of conspiracy theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Uscinski","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Enders","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Diekman","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Funchion","given":"John"},{"family":"Klofstad","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Kuebler","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Murthi","given":"Manohar"},{"family":"Premaratne","given":"Kamal"},{"family":"Seelig","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Verdear","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Wuchty","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"uscinskiPsychologicalPoliticalCorrelates2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-25617-0","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,15]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"21672","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The psychological and political correlates of conspiracy theory beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25617-0","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"vamosHPVVaccineFraming2008","abstract":"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus responsible for cervical cancer, is the most common viral sexually transmitted infection in the United States. A vaccine was approved in 2006 that is effective in preventing the types of HPV responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts. Proposals for routine and mandatory HPV vaccination of girls have become sources of controversy for parents of school-aged youth, legislators, members of the medical community, and the public at large. Methods: The purpose of this article was to articulate the arguments used by advocates who either oppose or endorse routine, mandatory administration of the vaccine to school-aged girls, thereby assisting school health personnel in being effective participants in framing the relevant issues. Results: Controversy is grounded in moral, religious, political, economic, and sociocultural arguments including whether concerns that the vaccine increases sexual risk taking, sends mixed messages about abstaining from sexual intercourse, usurps parental authority, and increases the potential for development of new health disparities are offset by the value of administering a cost-effective, age-appropriate public health measure targeting a life-threatening problem. Conclusions: Careful consideration of the medical evidence and public health implications is critical but understanding the context of the debate is no less important to the task of responding to public concerns. School health personnel have a role in the discussion about HPV immunization. Being able to articulate the arguments presented herein can help authorities’ responsiveness to parents and community groups as the dialogue about this particular health issue evolves further.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Vamos","given":"Cheryl A."},{"family":"McDermott","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Daley","given":"Ellen M."}],"citation-key":"vamosHPVVaccineFraming2008","container-title":"Journal of School Health","DOI":"10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00306.x","ISSN":"1746-1561","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008, American School Health Association","page":"302-309","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The HPV Vaccine: Framing the Arguments FOR and AGAINST Mandatory Vaccination of All Middle School Girls","title-short":"The HPV Vaccine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00306.x","volume":"78"},

  {"id":"vandoornSkepticalImportMotivated2024","abstract":"Central to many discussions of motivated reasoning is the idea that it runs afoul of epistemic normativity. Reasoning differently about information supporting our prior beliefs versus information contradicting those beliefs, is frequently equated with motivated irrationality. By analyzing the normative status of belief polarization, selective scrutiny, biased assimilation and the myside bias, I show this inference is often not adequately supported. Contrary to what’s often assumed, these phenomena need not indicate motivated irrationality, even though they are instances of belief-consistent information processing. Second, I engage with arguments purporting to show that belief-consistent information processing does not indicate motivated irrationality because of its mere differential treatment of confirming and non-confirming evidence, but rather because it reveals the undermining presence of an irrelevant influence, such as a desire or partisan identity-driven cognition. While linking belief-consistent reasoning to a deeper source of directional motivation to make good on the claim that it indicates motivated irrationality is indeed what’s needed, two prominent such arguments fail. The non-normativity of many reasoning processes often taken to indicate motivated irrationality is not in fact well established.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Doorn","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vandoornSkepticalImportMotivated2024","container-title":"Thinking & Reasoning","DOI":"10.1080/13546783.2023.2276975","ISSN":"1354-6783","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,1]]},"page":"548-578","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The skeptical import of motivated reasoning: a closer look at the evidence","title-short":"The skeptical import of motivated reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13546783.2023.2276975","volume":"30"},

In this short report, I present an overview of different unpublished studies that we conducted in my lab over the past years. Across the different studies we observed consistent effects of our experimental manipulations or variables of interest on self-report measures, but less so on behavioral and neurocognitive measures. For instance, religious people said they were more prosocial but did not donate more money (Study 1 and 2); participants experienced awe but this did not affect their body and self perception (Study 6 and 7); participants had mystical-like experiences but this did not affect the perception of their peripersonal space (Study 8 and 9); and self-reported magical thinking was unrelated to superstitious behavior (Study 11). In other studies, the hypothesized effects did not bear out as expected or were even in an unexpected direction. Participants perceived more agency in threatening pictures and scenarios, but this was not related to their supernatural beliefs (Study 3–5) and a death priming manipulation reduced rather than increased participants’ religiosity (Study 10). Thus, opening the filedrawer through the publication of short reports will hopefully further increase transparency and will help other researchers to learn from our own trials and errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Elk","given":"Michiel","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanelkWhatsHiddenMy2021","container-title":"Religion, Brain & Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/2153599X.2020.1729233","ISSN":"2153-599X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,2]]},"page":"5-16","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What’s hidden in my filedrawer and what’s in yours?

In many countries outside Europe, and especially in developing countries, interest in science and technology remains strong. As part of the large-scale European Union funded ‘Science Education for Diversity’ project, a questionnaire probing potential reasons for this difference was completed by students in the UK, Netherlands, Turkey, Lebanon, India and Malaysia. This questionnaire sought information about favourite courses, extracurricular activities and views on the nature of science. Over 9,000 students aged mainly between 10 and 14 years completed the questionnaire. Results revealed that students in countries outside Western Europe showed a greater interest in school science, in careers related to science and in extracurricular activities related to science than did Western European students. Non-European students were also more likely to hold an empiricist view of the nature of science and to believe that science can solve many problems faced by the world.

Many scholars say no: that religious people, in a matter-of-fact way, simply think their deities exist. Others say yes: that religious beliefs are more compartmentalized, less certain, and less responsive to evidence. Little research to date has explored whether lay people themselves recognize such a difference. We addressed this question in a series of sentence completion tasks, conducted in five settings that differed both in religious traditions and in language: the United States, Ghana, Thailand, China, and Vanuatu. Participants everywhere routinely used different verbs to describe religious versus matter-of-fact beliefs, and they did so even when the ascribed belief contents were held constant and only the surrounding context varied. These findings support the view that people from diverse cultures and language communities recognize a difference in attitude type between religious belief and everyday matter-of-fact belief.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Leeuwen","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Weisman","given":"Kara"},{"family":"Luhrmann","given":"Tanya Marie"}],"citation-key":"vanleeuwenBelieveNotThink2021","container-title":"Open Mind","DOI":"10.1162/opmi_a_00044","ISSN":"2470-2986","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"To Believe Is Not to Think: A Cross-Cultural Finding","title-short":"To Believe Is Not to Think","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/article/doi/10.1162/opmi_a_00044/106928/To-Believe-Is-Not-to-Think-A-Cross-Cultural"},

Why do so many people around the globe believe conspiracy theories, and why are they so influential? Previous research focused on the proximate mechanisms underlying conspiracy beliefs but ignored the distal, evolutionary origins and functions. We review evidence pertaining to two competing evolutionary hypotheses: (a) conspiracy beliefs are a by-product of a suite of psychological mechanisms (e.g., pattern recognition, agency detection, threat management, alliance detection) that evolved for different reasons, or (b) conspiracy beliefs are part of an evolved psychological mechanism specifically aimed at detecting dangerous coalitions. This latter perspective assumes that conspiracy theories are activated after specific coalition cues, which produce functional counterstrategies to cope with suspected conspiracies. Insights from social, cultural and evolutionary psychology provide tentative support for six propositions that follow from the adaptation hypothesis. We propose that people possess a functionally integrated mental system to detect conspiracies that in all likelihood has been shaped in an ancestral human environment in which hostile coalitions—that is, conspiracies that truly existed—were a frequent cause of misery, death, and reproductive loss.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Vugt","given":"Mark","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanprooijenConspiracyTheoriesEvolved2018","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691618774270","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"770-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conspiracy Theories: Evolved Functions and Psychological Mechanisms","title-short":"Conspiracy Theories","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618774270","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"vanprooijenConspiracyTheoriesPart2017","abstract":"In the present contribution, we examine the link between societal crisis situations and belief in conspiracy theories. Contrary to common assumptions, belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout human history. We first illustrate historical incidents suggesting that societal crisis situations—defined as impactful and rapid societal change that calls established power structures, norms of conduct, or even the existence of specific people or groups into question—have stimulated belief in conspiracy theories. We then review the psychological literature to explain why this is the case. Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings that people experience when in crisis—fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control—stimulate a motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social situations. We then explain that after being formed, conspiracy theories can become historical narratives that may spread through cultural transmission. We conclude that conspiracy theories originate particularly in crisis situations and may form the basis for how people subsequently remember and mentally represent a historical event.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Karen M"}],"citation-key":"vanprooijenConspiracyTheoriesPart2017","container-title":"Memory Studies","container-title-short":"Memory Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1750698017701615","ISSN":"1750-6980, 1750-6999","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7]]},"language":"en","page":"323-333","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conspiracy theories as part of history: The role of societal crisis situations","title-short":"Conspiracy theories as part of history","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1750698017701615","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"vanprooijenExistentialThreatModel2020","abstract":"People endorse conspiracy theories particularly when they experience existential threat, that is, feelings of anxiety or uncertainty often because of distressing societal events. At the same time, such feelings also often lead people to support groups frequently implicated in conspiracy theories (e.g., the government). The present contribution aims to resolve this paradox by proposing an Existential Threat Model of Conspiracy Theories, which stipulates under what conditions existential threat does versus does not stimulate conspiracy theories. The model specifically illuminates that feelings of existential threat increase epistemic sense-making processes, which in turn stimulate conspiracy theories only when antagonistic outgroups are salient. Moreover, once formed conspiracy theories are not functional to reduce feelings of existential threat; instead, conspiracy theories can be a source of existential threat in itself, stimulating further conspiracy theorizing and contributing to a generalized conspiracist mindset. In the discussion, I discuss implications of the model, and illuminate how one may base interventions on the model to breaks this cyclical process and reduce conspiracy beliefs.

We examined conspiracy theories that are relevant (portraying the Muslim community as victim or Jewish people as perpetrators) and irrelevant for participants' Muslim identity (about the 2007 financial crisis, and other theories such as that the moon landings were fake). Results revealed that Muslims believed both identity‐relevant and irrelevant conspiracy theories more strongly than non‐Muslims. These differences could not be attributed to the contents of Muslim faith: Ethnic minority status exerted similar effects independent of Muslim identity. Instead, evidence suggested that feelings of both personal and group‐based deprivation independently contribute to belief in conspiracy theories. We conclude that feelings of deprivation lead marginalized minority members to perceive the social and political system as rigged, stimulating belief in both identity‐relevant and irrelevant conspiracy theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Staman","given":"Jaap"},{"family":"Krouwel","given":"André P.M."}],"citation-key":"vanprooijenIncreasedConspiracyBeliefs2018","container-title":"Applied Cognitive Psychology","container-title-short":"Appl Cognit Psychol","DOI":"10.1002/acp.3442","ISSN":"08884080","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"661-667","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Increased conspiracy beliefs among ethnic and Muslim minorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/acp.3442","volume":"32"},

Second, because of artiﬁcial lab procedures, previous ﬁndings provide little information about the external validity of the control threat–conspiracy belief relationship. In Study 1, we address the ﬁrst limitation and ﬁnd that afﬁrming control indeed reduces belief in conspiracy theories as compared with a neutral baseline condition. In Study 2, we address the second limitation of the literature. In a large-scale US sample, we ﬁnd that a societal threat to control, that citizens actually experienced, predicts belief in a range of common conspiracy theories.

  {"id":"vanprooijenInjusticeEvidenceUnique2022","abstract":"Conspiracy theories are widespread and have a profound impact on society. The present contribution proposes that conspiracy theories are explanatory narratives that necessarily contain justice judgments, as they include attributions of blame and accusations of unethical or criminal conduct. Conspiratorial narratives also are mental simulations, however, and may elicit genuine feelings of injustice also without evidence of actual malpractice. Indeed, conspiracy theories sometimes describe unfair events that are unlikely to have occurred, unethical authorities that might not actually exist, and so on. Here I propose two complementary processes that stimulate belief in evidence-free conspiracy theories: (1) Existential threats instigate biased mental processing and motivated reasoning, that jointly promote an alternative perception of reality; and (2) group allegiances shape how people perceive, interpret, and remember facts to highlight the immoral qualities of competing outgroups. Due to these processes, conspiracy theories elicit a set of distinct reactions such as poor health choices and rejection of science. Moreover, evidence-free conspiracy theories require interventions beyond traditional approaches to install justice principles, such as debunking falsehoods and reducing polarized intergroup distinctions. I conclude that the scientific study of conspiracy theories is part of, and has a unique place in, social justice research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanprooijenInjusticeEvidenceUnique2022","container-title":"Social Justice Research","container-title-short":"Soc Just Res","DOI":"10.1007/s11211-021-00376-x","ISSN":"1573-6725","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"88-106","source":"Springer Link","title":"Injustice Without Evidence: The Unique Role of Conspiracy Theories in Social Justice Research","title-short":"Injustice Without Evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-021-00376-x","volume":"35"},

The present contribution empirically tests whether extreme political ideologies, at either side of the political spectrum, are positively associated with an increased tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Four studies conducted in the United States and the Netherlands revealed a quadratic relationship between strength of political ideology and conspiracy beliefs about various political issues. Moreover, participants’ belief in simple political solutions to societal problems mediated conspiracy beliefs among both left- and right-wing extremists.

What are the implications of this suspicion of institutions for people’s social relationships? The current paper proposes that institutions have at least two functions to regulate citizens’ social relationships: providing people with a sense of safety, and providing models for group norms and values. Suspicion of institutions undermines both of these functions, and therefore yields a range of negative societal outcomes by impacting people’s interpersonal, within-group, and between-group relationships. More specifically, suspicion of institutions reduces trust between strangers, within-group cooperation, commitment, and prosocial behavior, and increases prejudice, intergroup conflict, polarization, and extremism.

These threats often give rise to belief in conspiracy theories, which assume such events to be injustices that were secretly and deliberately planned by legitimate authorities or institutions. In the present chapter I propose that conspiracy beliefs are functional for basic sense-making desires when faced with events that threaten the social order. Recent ﬁndings indicate that contextual and personal factors that are likely to elicit sense-making activities (e.g., lacking control, feelings of uncertainty, high need for structure) increase the association between the perceived morality of institutions and conspiracy beliefs. Furthermore, additional ﬁndings reveal that an underlying mechanism why sense-making activities may lead to conspiracy beliefs is that people tend to attribute big causes to big events. To illuminate practical implications I connect these insights to knowledge on procedural justice, and reason that adhering to procedural justice principles may help to decrease conspiracy beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Prooijen","given":"Jan-Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanprooijenSuspicionsInjusticeSenseMaking2011","container-title":"Justice and Conflicts","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-19035-3_7","editor":[{"family":"Kals","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Maes","given":"Jürgen"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-642-19034-6 978-3-642-19035-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"121-132","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Suspicions of Injustice: The Sense-Making Function of Belief in Conspiracy Theories","title-short":"Suspicions of Injustice","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-19035-3_7"},

Similar ﬁndings emerged using an individual difference measure of perspective-taking abilities, and with different operationalizations of conspiracy beliefs (Studies 2 and 3).

Across two studies (N=283, N=332), we explore the hypothesis that laypeople make more fine-grained distinctions among different kinds of “belief.” Specifically, we find evidence that beliefs with matching contents are judged differently depending on whether those beliefs are seen as playing predominantly epistemic roles (such as tracking evidence with the aim of forming accurate representations) versus non-epistemic roles (such as social signaling). Beliefs with epistemic aims, compared to those with non-epistemic aims, are more likely to be described with the term “thinks” (vs. “believes”), and to be redescribed in probabilistic (vs. binary) terms. These findings call for a refinement of the concepts posited to underly theory of mind and offer indirect support for the idea that human psychology in fact features more than one kind of belief.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Vesga","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Van Leeuwen","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Lombrozo","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"vesgaEvidenceDistinctCognitive","language":"en","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Evidence for distinct cognitive attitudes of belief in theory of mind","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7hm615q7#main"},

We explore this possibility using an experiment with a nationally representative sample of Americans in the fall of 2015. We find that risk communication on controversial scientific issues sometimes influences perceptions of the political orientations and credibility of the communicating scientist when the scientist addresses the risks of issues associated with conservative or liberal groups. This relationship is moderated by participant political ideology, with liberals adjusting their perceptions of the scientists' political beliefs more substantially when the scientist addressed the risks of marijuana use when compared with other issues. Conservatives' political perceptions were less impacted by the issue context of the scientific risk communication but indirectly influenced credibility perceptions. Our results support a contextual model of audience interpretation of scientific risk communication.

In this process the novel often plays the role of an icon of modernity in situations that evoke the idea of progress, while the traditional prevails in more static social structures such as the family. This co-existence of rarely compatible representations is called cognitive polyphasia.

Respondents from Spain and Nicaragua produced free associations about war and peace. Word associations about each of the two stimulus words were produced either spontaneously or within the context of a distracting priming condition in contrast to the association task. The semantic space for each stimulus word (war, peace) is analysed to find substructures of words which remain stable across contexts. These substructures or stable cores are taken to indicate a well-structured social representation as opposed to a loosely organized knowledge domain. Such cores were found for associations about war in both countries, but for peace in the Nicaraguan sample only. This finding is interpreted as a consequence of public discourse and symbolic coping with relevant or threatening objects or phenomena. Stable cores were found to consist primarily of ‘hot’ words, i.e. words which are proximal to an individual's experience. More intellectual and distant (‘cold’) words did not enter the stable core. Results are discussed in terms of the central core theory of social representations and of numerical consensus being an insufficient criterion for social representations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Valencia","given":"José"},{"family":"Elejabarrieta","given":"Fran"}],"citation-key":"wagnerRelevanceDiscourseHot1996","container-title":"British Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01101.x","ISSN":"2044-8309","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","page":"331-351","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Relevance, discourse and the ‘hot’ stable core social representations—A structural analysis of word associations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01101.x","volume":"35"},

Nevertheless, participants of all ages organized their judgments according to the realm of diversity, thought that some beliefs are relative and some are nonrelative, and made tolerant judgments of some divergent beliefs (and their proponents) but not of others.

The current work examines these differences in the persuasion domain, but this distinction has implications for other domains as well. Two experiments clarify the conceptual distinction between bias (skewed perception) and untrustworthiness (dishonesty) and three studies demonstrate that source bias can have a negative effect on persuasion and source credibility beyond any parallel effects of untrustworthiness, lack of expertise, and dislikability.

Four studies indicate that conspiracy belief is driven by readiness to draw implausible causal connections even when events are not random, but instead conform to an objective pattern. Study 1 (N = 195) showed that conspiracy belief was related to the causal interpretation of real-life, spurious correlations (e.g., between chocolate consumption and Nobel prizes). In Study 2 (N = 216), this effect held adjusting for correlates including magical and non-analytical thinking. Study 3 (N = 214) showed that preference for conspiracy explanations was associated with the perception that a focal event (e.g., the death of a journalist) was causally connected to similar, recent events. Study 4 (N = 211) showed that conspiracy explanations for human tragedies were favored when they comprised part of a cluster of similar events (vs. occurring in isolation); crucially, they were independently increased by a manipulation of causal perception.

Using a new text analytic approach, we quantitatively measure the similarity between 7613 participant generated explanations. We find that the relative homogeneity of Christian and non-religious people's explanations vary depending on the kind of phenomena being explained. Non-religious people provided more similar explanations for natural than supernatural phenomena, whereas Christian explanations were relatively similar across both natural and supernatural phenomena. This challenges the idea that religious systems standardize and restrict people's worldviews in general, and instead suggest this effect is domain specific. We also find Christian and non-religious participants used largely overlapping concepts to explain natural and supernatural phenomena.

This particular need is conceived of as a desire for definite knowledge on some issue and the eschewal of confusion and ambiguity. It is considered proportionate in magnitude to the perceived benefits of closure and the costs of lacking closure. Those benefits and costs, in turn, are assumed to vary situationally and also represent stable individual differences in the tendency to value closure. The consequences of the need for closure are assumed to derive from two general tendencies, those of urgency and permanence, respectively. The urgency tendency refers to the inclination to attain closure without delay, and to “seize” on early information potentially leading to closure. The permanence tendency refers to the inclination to maintain closure for as long as possible, hence to “freeze” on present closure and safeguard future closure. Those dual tendencies are shown to impact a broad variety of social psychological phenomena on intrapersonal, interpersonal and group levels of analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Webster","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Kruglanski","given":"Arie W."}],"citation-key":"websterCognitiveSocialConsequences1997","container-title":"European Review of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/14792779643000100","ISSN":"1046-3283","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",1,1]]},"page":"133-173","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Cognitive and Social Consequences of the Need for Cognitive Closure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14792779643000100","volume":"8"},

The present study used data from 296,959 individuals in around 90 countries from the World Values Survey/European Values Study to test the relative strength of individual differences in cooperative morals and reproductive morals in predicting individual differences in religiosity. Cooperative morals tended not to predict religiosity either substantially or in a consistent direction across world regions when entered simultaneously with reproductive morals. In contrast, more-restrictive reproductive morals were significant predictors of increased religiosity in every region, with the size of the relationship being small in poorer regions and large in wealthier regions. These findings run counter to the view that religiosity has a fundamental connection with cooperative morals; instead, particularly in developed countries, individuals’ relationships with religious groups are more closely aligned with reproductive strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Weeden","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Kurzban","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"weedenWhatPredictsReligiosity2013","container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.08.006","ISSN":"1090-5138","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"440-445","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What predicts religiosity?

  {"id":"weingartPublicEngagementScience2021","abstract":"‘Public engagement with science’ has become a ‘buzzword’ reflecting a concern about the widening gap between science and society and efforts to bridge this gap. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the development of the ‘engagement’ rhetoric in the pertinent academic literature on science communication and in science policy documents. By way of a content analysis of articles published in three leading science communication journals and a selection of science policy documents from the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and South Africa (SA), the variety of motives underlying this rhetoric, as well as the impact it has on science policies, are analyzed. The analysis of the science communication journals reveals an increasingly vague and inclusive definition of ‘engagement’ as well as of the ‘public’ being addressed, and a diverse range of motives driving the rhetoric. Similar observations can be made about the science policy documents. This study corroborates an earlier diagnosis that rhetoric is running ahead of practice and suggests that communication and engagement with clearly defined stakeholder groups about specific problems and the pertinent scientific knowledge will be a more successful manner of ‘engagement’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Weingart","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Joubert","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Connoway","given":"Karien"}],"citation-key":"weingartPublicEngagementScience2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0254201","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e0254201","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Public engagement with science—Origins, motives and impact in academic literature and science policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254201","volume":"16"},

We present a novel agent-based model of scientific research in which scientists divide their labor to explore an unknown epistemic landscape. Scientists aim to find the most epistemically significant research approaches. We consider three different search strategies that scientists can adopt for exploring the landscape. In the first, scientists work alone and do not let the discoveries of the community influence their actions. This is compared with two social research strategies: Followers are biased toward what others have already discovered, and we find that pure populations of these scientists do less well than scientists acting independently. However, pure populations of mavericks, who try to avoid research approaches that have already been taken, vastly outperform the other strategies. Finally, we show that, in mixed populations, mavericks stimulate followers to greater levels of epistemic production, making polymorphic populations of mavericks and followers ideal in many research domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Weisberg","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Muldoon","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"weisbergEpistemicLandscapesDivision2009","container-title":"Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1086/644786","ISSN":"0031-8248, 1539-767X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4]]},"language":"en","page":"225-252","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Epistemic Landscapes and the Division of Cognitive Labor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy-of-science/article/abs/epistemic-landscapes-and-the-division-of-cognitive-labor/95D16D3CB181A990FDFAC6E92CCF5709","volume":"76"},

The MRI is also summative, yielding a single quantitative measurement of left–right religious ideology with good scale and test–retest reliability. Analysis of 839 respondents across two studies confirmed the widespread assumption that religious ideology is a parallel construct to political ideology, emerging from similar foundations but following a distinct set of rules.

However, to date, these hypotheses have not been tested simultaneously and in relation to each other, using an individual difference approach. We used a path model to assess the extent to which several interacting cognitive tendencies, namely mentalizing, mind body dualism, teleological thinking, and anthropomorphism, as well as cultural exposure to religion, predict belief in God, paranormal beliefs and belief in life’s purpose. Our model, based on two independent samples (N=492 and N=920) found that the previously known relationship between mentalizing and belief is mediated by individual differences in dualism, and to a lesser extent by teleological thinking. Anthropomorphism was unrelated to religious belief, but was related to paranormal belief. Cultural exposure to religion (mostly Christianity) was negatively related to anthropomorphism, and was unrelated to any of the other cognitive tendencies. These patterns were robust for both men and women, and across at least two ethnic identifications. The data were most consistent with a path model suggesting that mentalizing comes first, which leads to dualism and teleology, which in turn lead to religious, paranormal, and life’s-purpose beliefs.

Cognitive biases (Jumping to Conclusions, Intentionalising, Catastrophising, Emotional Reasoning, and dichotomous thinking) correlated positively with belief in the paranormal. Mediation using path analysis indicated that Emotional Reasoning and Catastrophising exerted indirect effects in relation to BISS, IPO-RT and RPBS.

  {"id":"wiltDailyMeasuresReligious2022","abstract":"Prior research suggests robust links between religious/spiritual struggles and lower levels of mental health. This work has examined trait measures of religious/spiritual struggles over various time frames, such as “over the past couple of weeks,” and “over the last few months,” and “over your lifetime.” However, these assessments do not characterize the potentially dynamic and changing day-to-day experience of religious/spiritual struggle as psychological states. The present study used experience sampling methods to assess multiple domains of religious/spiritual struggles (divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, doubt, and ultimate meaning) each day for 1 week. We included trait measures of these religious/spiritual struggles as well as the measures of mental health (depression, anxiety, satisfaction with life, and meaning in life) prior to and after the experience sampling portion. Participants (N = 316, number of daily reports = 1,980) were undergraduates from a private university in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Daily measures showed reliable within- and between-person variation. Correlational and multilevel path analytic results provided the evidence of convergent and discriminant validity among measures of religious/spiritual struggles. Correlations showed similar patterns of relations between religious/spiritual struggle measures and mental health variables that replicated previous findings. These findings suggest that religious/spiritual struggles may be assessed meaningfully at the daily level. Therefore, the assessments of religious/spiritual struggles at the daily level could facilitate studying the development of religious/spiritual struggles and their relations to mental health over time.

Assessing levels of such trust is important in determining attitudes and predicting behaviours in response to medical and scientific interventions targeted at managing public crises.

The Trust in Science and Scientists Scale has been adopted with increasing frequency in large-scale public health research. Detailed psychometric evaluation of the scale is overdue and makes meaningful comparisons between studies that use the scale difficult.

  {"id":"wollastRussiansAttitudesWar2024","abstract":"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused considerable military casualties on both sides and widespread harm to Ukrainian civilians. While polls suggest that a slim majority of Russians endorse the invasion, the factors underpinning this support remain uncertain. We investigated factors associated with support for the war among Russians. In three large, diverse, samples of Russian adults (total N = 2856), we extend the dual process motivational model to the context of international warfare, focusing on two key ideologies: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Consistent with polling data, we find that approximately half of the participants support the war. Across studies, RWA, especially its submission facet, emerges as a strong and consistent predictor of increased support for the war in Ukraine. In contrast, the associations with SDO are weaker and more inconsistent, with anti-egalitarianism playing only a minor role in opposing peace efforts. Additionally, factors such as Russian identification, nationalism, group efficacy, war-related misperceptions and collective narcissism also contribute to war support. Our findings suggest that Russian support for the war may reflect broader support for the existing regime with backing for the military intervention serving as a demonstration of loyalty to Vladimir Putin and his government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wollast","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Joseph B."},{"family":"Yahiiaiev","given":"Illia"},{"family":"Malysheva","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Sengupta","given":"Nikhil K."}],"citation-key":"wollastRussiansAttitudesWar2024","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Eur.

  {"id":"worldhealthorganizationwhoWHOUNICEFWarn2020","abstract":"GENEVA/NEW YORK, 15 July 2020 – The World Health Organization and UNICEF warned today of an alarming decline in the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world. This is due to disruptions in the delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to new data by WHO and UNICEF, these disruptions threaten to reverse hard-won progress to reach more children and adolescents with a wider range of vaccines, which has already been hampered by a decade of stalling coverage.  The latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from WHO and UNICEF for 2019 shows that improvements such as the expansion of the HPV vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. For example, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 points to a substantial drop in the number of children completing three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). This is the first time in 28 years that the world could see a reduction in DTP3 coverage – the marker for immunization coverage within and across countries. “Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunized than ever before,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But the pandemic has put those gains at risk. The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Vaccines can be delivered safely even during the pandemic, and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life-saving programmes continue.”  COVID-19 disruptions Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being cancelled, which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond. According to a new UNICEF, WHO and Gavi pulse survey,  conducted in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, three quarters of the 82 countries that responded reported COVID-19 related disruptions in their immunization programmes as of May 2020. The reasons for disrupted services vary. Even when services are offered, people are either unable to access them because of reluctance to leave home, transport interruptions, economic hardships, restrictions on movement, or fear of being exposed to people with COVID-19. Many health workers are also unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to COVID response duties as well as a lack of protective equipment. “COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before children’s lives are threatened by other diseases. We cannot trade one health crisis for another.”   Stagnating global coverage rate  Progress on immunization coverage was stalling before COVID-19 hit, at 85 per cent for DTP3 and measles vaccines. The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of 5 is less than 20 per cent.  In 2019, nearly 14 million children missed out on life-saving vaccines such as measles and DTP3. Most of these children live in Africa and are likely to lack access to other health services. Two-thirds of them are concentrated in 10 middle- and low-income countries: Angola, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Philippines. Children in middle-income countries account for an increasing share of the burden.  Progress and challenges, by country and region There has been some progress. Regional coverage for the third dose of DTP in South Asia has increased by 12 percentage points over the last 10 years, notably across India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, that hard-won progress could be undone by COVID-19 related disruptions. Countries that had recorded significant progress, such as Ethiopia and Pakistan, are now also at risk of backsliding if immunization services are not restored as soon as feasible.  The situation is especially concerning for Latin America and the Caribbean, where historically high coverage has slipped over the last decade. In Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela, immunization coverage plummeted by at least 14 percentage points since 2010. These countries are now also confronting moderate to severe COVID19-related disruptions.    As the global health community attempts to recover lost ground due to COVID-19 related disruptions, UNICEF and WHO are supporting countries in their efforts to reimagine immunization and build back better by: Restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, by adhering to hygiene and physical distancing recommendations and providing protective equipment to health workers; Helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain how services have been reconfigured to ensure safety;Rectifying coverage and immunity gaps; Expanding routine services to reach missed communities, where some of the most vulnerable children live.### Notes to editorsDownload photos , the report, data files and b-roll from UNICEF here or from WHO here.

About the data 2019 IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE ESTIMATESEvery year, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) produce a new round of immunization coverage estimates for 195 countries, enabling a critical assessment of how well we are doing in reaching every child with life-saving vaccines.  In addition to producing the immunization coverage estimates for 2019, the WHO and UNICEF estimation process revises the entire historical series of immunization data with the latest available information. The 2019 revision covers 39 years of coverage estimates, from 1980 to 2019. DTP3 coverage is used as an indicator to assess the proportion of children vaccinated and is calculated for children under one year of age. The estimated number of vaccinated children are calculated using population data provided by the 2019 World Population Prospects (WPP) from the UN. Fact sheet.IMMUNIZATION PULSE SURVEY, JUNE 2020The new UNICEF, WHO and Gavi pulse survey was conducted in collaboration with US Centers for Disease Control, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in June 2020. Respondents from 82 countries, including 14 with lower than 80 per cent vaccination coverage rates in 2019, reported on disruptions in immunization services due to COVID-19 as of May 2020.  The online immunization pulse survey received responses from 260 immunization experts, including representatives of Ministries of Health, academia and global health organizations across 82 countries. A previous pulse poll, conducted in April received 801 responses from 107 countries, showed that disruption to the routine immunization programs were already widespread and affected all regions. 64 per cent of countries represented in that poll indicated that routine immunizations had been disrupted or even suspended. The World Health Organization provides global leadership in public health within the United Nations system. Founded in 1948, WHO works with 194 Member States, across six regions and from more than 150 offices, to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. Our goal for 2019-2023 is to ensure that a billion more people have universal health coverage, to protect a billion more people from health emergencies, and provide a further billion people with better health and wellbeing.

The AEIOU framework was adopted for use as the major component of SEC to depict participants’ general perceptions of science communication from their daily life experiences. Responses from 121 participants were analysed using exploratory factor analysis; item discrimination; and qualitative coding analysis. Results support SEC-AEIOU as a valid and reliable instrument to measure the effectiveness of science communication experiences. Additionally; SEC-AEIOU can serve as a framework for research and practice to bridge science communication and science education. In particular; science communicators; educators; and institutions that engage in science communication and educational activities may benefit from such a metric. This scale seeks to assist in building a robust framework to facilitate the trend of bridging science communication and science education: Science Edu-Communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Leon Yufeng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shannah Pinhsuan"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Chun-Yen"}],"citation-key":"wuMergingScienceEducation2019","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su11174551","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"17","page":"4551","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Merging Science Education into Communication: Developing and Validating a Scale for Science Edu-Communication Utilizing Awareness, Enjoyment, Interest, Opinion formation, and Understanding Dimensions (SEC-AEIOU)","title-short":"Merging Science Education into Communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/17/4551","volume":"11"},

We conducted a U.S. national survey for three main purposes. First, we aim to examine the association between social media news consumption and conspiracy beliefs specific to COVID-19 and general conspiracy beliefs. Second, we investigate the influence of an important moderator, social media news trust, that has been overlooked in prior studies. Third, we further propose a moderated moderation model by including misinformation identification. Our findings show that social media news use was associated with higher conspiracy beliefs, and trust in social media news was found to be a significant moderator of the relationship between social media news use and conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, our findings show that misinformation identification moderated the relationship between social media news use and trust.

  {"id":"yaffeSystematicReviewDifferences2020","abstract":"Parenting is a broad construct that comprises stable and durable attitudes and behaviors regarding child-rearing. Since mothers and fathers play different roles in the family, parenting styles and practices in childhood and adolescence may differ depending on the parents’ and adolescents’ gender. While gender differences in parenting are theoretically warranted, the research literature in this field is considerably limited and lacking conclusive information dealing with this question. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to aggregate and synthesize the available research studies containing significant findings on the differences between mothers and fathers in parenting styles and practices. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic search of the PsycInfo, Scopus, Eric, and Web of Science databases, covering literature published from 1990 to 2020. The search was restricted to peer-reviewed studies in English alone. Our findings reveal that mothers as compared to fathers are perceived as more accepting, responsive, and supportive, as well as more behaviorally controlling, demanding, and autonomy granting than fathers. Accordingly, in the studies comparing parents on the constructs of overall parenting styles, mothers were predominantly more authoritative than fathers, and fathers were mostly more authoritarian than mothers (based on both parent and descendant reports). These parental differences established by research from over 15 countries around the globe seem to apply similarly for male and female descendants, while principally not varying by their age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Yaffe","given":"Yosi"}],"citation-key":"yaffeSystematicReviewDifferences2020","container-title":"Current Psychology","container-title-short":"Curr Psychol","DOI":"10.1007/s12144-020-01014-6","ISSN":"1936-4733","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,23]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Systematic review of the differences between mothers and fathers in parenting styles and practices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01014-6"},

In this case study, citizens in contending communities and scientists in a forest management controversy constructed the scientists’ credibility differently. Shared values and views of the nature of science and objectivity were primary factors for constructing scientists’ credibility. Citizens who expected value-free, objective scientists to authenticate their knowledge were concerned about how the values of scientists on the opposite side affected research framing. Citizens who emphasized limited objectivity were less skeptical of scientists. Scientists acknowledged their values but defended their credibility in terms of professional standards, balance and resource constraints. In short, scientists’ credibility is relative because each individual has unique values and views of the nature of science and objectivity. Through a collaborative policymaking process, citizens and scientists should develop shared values and visions to reconstruct a temporary, intersubjective sense of credibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Yuri T."}],"citation-key":"yamamotoValuesObjectivityCredibility2012","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662510371435","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101-125","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Values, objectivity and credibility of scientists in a contentious natural resource debate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662510371435","volume":"21"},

Several taxonomies, consisting of different views by which people relate science and religion, can be found in the philosophical literature. However, most of the science education literature uses these taxonomies selectively and with limited justification, hindering comparison between existing and future studies. The first aim of this paper is therefore to provide a comprehensive review of the different taxonomies described in the literature and to organise the different views according to their similarities and differences. The second aim of the paper is to present a new research tool developed on the basis of the findings of the literature review. This tool consists of a short questionnaire allowing educational researchers to identify the different viewpoints held by pre-service teachers, undergraduates majoring in biology and school learners. We present the tool itself and demonstrate its usefulness and versatility for future science education research based on three empirical studies covering a range of geographical areas, religious backgrounds, educational levels, age groups and genders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yasri","given":"Pratchayapong"},{"family":"Arthur","given":"Shagufta"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Mike U."},{"family":"Mancy","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013","container-title":"Science & Education","container-title-short":"Sci & Educ","DOI":"10/f5d67m","ISSN":"1573-1901","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2679-2707","source":"Springer Link","title":"Relating Science and Religion: An Ontology of Taxonomies and Development of a Research Tool for Identifying Individual Views","title-short":"Relating Science and Religion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-013-9623-4","volume":"22"},

A phenomenographic study based on interviews with nine students studying in Christian high schools in Thailand led to the identification of five distinct positions on the relationship between science and religion. Each position was associated with a characteristic pattern of learning about evolution that could be explained as an attempt by the students to align their particular learning approach with their position. Three of the positions have the potential to support scientifically valid understandings of evolution while avoiding emotional conflict.

  {"id":"yilmazWhenScienceReplaces2015","abstract":"Scientific and religious thinking compete with each other on several levels. For example, activating one generally weakens the other. Since priming religion is known to increase moral behaviour and moral sensitivity, priming science might be expected to have the opposite effect. However, it was recently demonstrated that, on the contrary, science priming increases moral sensitivity as well. The present set of studies sought to replicate this effect and test two explanations for it. Study 1 used a sentence unscrambling task for implicitly priming the concept of science but failed to replicate its effect on moral sensitivity, presumably due to a ceiling effect. Study 2 replicated the effect with a new measure of moral sensitivity. Study 3 tested whether science-related words create this effect by activating the idea of secular authority or by activating analytic thinking. It was demonstrated that words related to secular authority, but not words related to analytic thinking, produced a similar increase in moral sensitivity. Religiosity level of the participants did not influence this basic finding. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that science as a secular institution has overtaken some of the functions of religion in modern societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Onurcan"},{"family":"Bahçekapili","given":"Hasan G."}],"citation-key":"yilmazWhenScienceReplaces2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0137499","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e0137499","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"When Science Replaces Religion: Science as a Secular Authority Bolsters Moral Sensitivity","title-short":"When Science Replaces Religion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137499","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"ysseldykReligiosityIdentityUnderstanding2010","abstract":"As a social identity anchored in a system of guiding beliefs and symbols, religion ought to serve a uniquely powerful function in shaping psychological and social processes. Religious identification offers a distinctive ?sacred? worldview and ?eternal? group membership, unmatched by identification with other social groups. Thus, religiosity might be explained, at least partially, by the marked cognitive and emotional value that religious group membership provides. The uniqueness of a positive social group, grounded in a belief system that offers epistemological and ontological certainty, lends religious identity a twofold advantage for the promotion of well-being. However, that uniqueness may have equally negative impacts when religious identity itself is threatened through intergroup conflict. Such consequences are illustrated by an examination of identities ranging from religious fundamentalism to atheism. Consideration of religion?s dual function as a social identity and a belief system may facilitate greater understanding of the variability in its importance across individuals and groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ysseldyk","given":"Renate"},{"family":"Matheson","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Anisman","given":"Hymie"}],"citation-key":"ysseldykReligiosityIdentityUnderstanding2010","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/1088868309349693","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"60-71","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Religiosity as Identity: Toward an Understanding of Religion From a Social Identity Perspective","title-short":"Religiosity as Identity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868309349693","volume":"14"},

Participants then indicated the extent to which they saw conﬂict or compatibility between science and religion when it came to ontological/existential questions. Across countries, we found that religious belief, independently of belief in science, predicted strong science–religion compatibility perceptions, while belief in science, independently of religious belief, predicted conﬂict.

The Polish CRS has been applied in more than 40 published studies on the psychology of religion, with over 18,000 total participants.

This paper shows how using the CRS sheds light on different patterns in which religion integrates with other psychological variables. It consists of three parts: first, we introduce the Polish adaptation of the CRS; second, we present the review of the research using the Polish CRS; and finally, we provide research results that suggest a curvilinear mechanism for explaining the categories of the centrality of religiosity. Three measures were applied to the research: the CRS, emotions toward God scale, and content of prayer scale-revised. The results indicated that there is a curvilinear relationship between centrality of religiosity and emotions toward God, prayer types, and styles of request prayer (excluding passive request prayer). We determined the changepoints at which the relationship between the centrality of religiosity and the religious contents changes. This finding allowed us to provide empirical confirmation of Huber’s thesis (2003) that there is a different way of operating low, medium, and high scores in centrality, namely marginal, subordinated, and central religiosity.

Also, participants who blamed the Jews for the coronavirus pandemic were inclined to refuse a coronavirus vaccination when it is available.

  {"id":"zellerReligionScienceAmerica2011","abstract":"Many people assume that the history of religion and science in America is one of conflict. However, this is not the case. While an examination of the relationship between religion and science in America shows a variety of ways that they have related, there are few cases of outright conflict. This article takes a historical approach to the topic of religion and science in America. It looks to how both Native Americans and colonial-era Americans fused religion and science into a single system, the reasons that this approach began to falter during the early republic and antebellum era, and the twentieth-century repercussions. It treats the history of natural theology, natural philosophy, Baconian science, fundamentalism, and the post-Einstein “new physics” of relativity and quantum science. Special attention is paid the famous Scopes Trial, as well as the contemporary Intelligent Design movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeller","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"zellerReligionScienceAmerica2011","container-title":"Religion Compass","DOI":"10.1111/j.1749-8171.2011.00265.x","ISSN":"1749-8171","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"139-149","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Religion and Science in America","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-8171.2011.00265.x","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"zembylasReligiousDoctrinesCritical2019","abstract":"The purpose of the present article is twofold: first, to examine whether epistemic switching is documented in the context of religious education; and second, if it is, to show the challenges as well as the strategies that teachers utilise when they engage in epistemic switching. The context of our study is religious education in the Greek-Cypriot educational system – an example of a confessional setting in which Greek Orthodox Christianity is the only religion being taught in schools. This article describes a qualitative case study research – which is part of a larger, 1-year project – that explores the understandings of religion and interculturalism as well as the pedagogical perspectives on religious education of six Greek-Cypriot primary school teachers. The findings show how the possibilities and obstacles of teachers’ epistemic switching could inform larger debates concerning the entanglements between critical religious education pedagogies and religious doctrines, especially within confessional educational contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Zembylas","given":"Michalinos"},{"family":"Loukaidis","given":"Loizos"},{"family":"Antoniou","given":"Marios"},{"family":"Antoniou","given":"Petroula"}],"citation-key":"zembylasReligiousDoctrinesCritical2019","container-title":"British Journal of Religious Education","DOI":"10.1080/01416200.2018.1484694","ISSN":"0141-6200","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,3]]},"page":"286-298","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Religious doctrines and critical religious education: teachers’ epistemic switching in a confessional setting","title-short":"Religious doctrines and critical religious education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01416200.2018.1484694","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"zemojtel-piotrowskaCommunalCollectiveNarcissism2021","abstract":"Objectives We aimed to introduce, validate, and showcase the utility of a new construct: communal collective narcissism. Method We conducted four studies, in which we developed a new scale for communal collective narcissism (Study 1, N = 856), tested the construct's unique predictions (Study 2, N = 276), examined its social relevance (Study 3, N = 250), and assessed its implications for intergroup outcomes (Study 4, N = 664). Results In Study 1, we verified the structural soundness of the Communal Collective Narcissism Inventory. In Study 2, we obtained evidence for a defining feature of communal collective narcissism, namely, that it predicts communal, but not agentic, ingroup-enhancement. In Study 3, we illustrated the social relevance of communal collective narcissism. Communal collective narcissists derogated outgroup members, if those outgroups threatened the ingroup and the threat targeted the ingroup's communion. Finally, in Study 4, we showed that communal collective narcissism predicts intergroup outcomes in the communal domain (e.g., humanitarian aid) better than agentic collective narcissism does, whereas agentic collective narcissism predicts intergroup outcomes in the agentic domain (i.e., preferences for military aggression) better than communal collective narcissism does. Conclusions The construct of communal collective narcissism is conceptually and empirically distinct from classic (i.e., agentic) collective narcissism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Żemojtel-Piotrowska","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Piotrowski","given":"Jarosław"},{"family":"Sedikides","given":"Constantine"},{"family":"Sawicki","given":"Artur"},{"family":"Czarna","given":"Anna Z."},{"family":"Fatfouta","given":"Ramzi"},{"family":"Baran","given":"Tomasz"}],"citation-key":"zemojtel-piotrowskaCommunalCollectiveNarcissism2021","container-title":"Journal of Personality","DOI":"10.1111/jopy.12636","ISSN":"1467-6494","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1062-1080","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Communal collective narcissism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12636","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"zhangDilutionModelHow2007","abstract":"Six experiments tested a dilution model of self-regulation, whereby increasing the number of goals (e.g., building muscles and losing weight) that a single means (e.g., exercising) can satisfy reduces the perception of its instrumentality with respect to each goal. The authors found that an increase in the number of simultaneous, salient goals that can be satisfied via a single means weakens the associative strength between that means and each individual goal, and as a result, individuals perceive the means as less effective for the attainment of each goal. Consequently, means that are connected to multiple (vs. single) goals are less likely to be chosen and pursued when only one of these goals is activated.

  {"id":"zuckermanNegativeIntelligenceReligiosity2020","abstract":"Zuckerman et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis of 63 studies that showed a negative intelligence?religiosity relation (IRR). As more studies have become available and because some of Zuckerman et al.?s (2013) conclusions have been challenged, we conducted a new meta-analysis with an updated data set of 83 studies. Confirming previous conclusions, the new analysis showed that the correlation between intelligence and religious beliefs in college and noncollege samples ranged from ?.20 to ?.23. There was no support for mediation of the IRR by education but there was support for partial mediation by analytic cognitive style. Thus, one possible interpretation for the IRR is that intelligent people are more likely to use analytic style (i.e., approach problems more rationally). An alternative (and less interesting) reason for the mediation is that tests of both intelligence and analytic style assess cognitive ability. Additional empirical and theoretical work is needed to resolve this issue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Miron"},{"family":"Li","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Shengxin"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Judith A."}],"citation-key":"zuckermanNegativeIntelligenceReligiosity2020","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1177/0146167219879122","ISSN":"0146-1672","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"856-868","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Negative Intelligence–Religiosity Relation: New and Confirming Evidence","title-short":"The Negative Intelligence–Religiosity Relation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167219879122","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"zuckermanRelationIntelligenceReligiosity2013","abstract":"A meta-analysis of 63 studies showed a significant negative association between intelligence and religiosity. The association was stronger for college students and the general population than for participants younger than college age; it was also stronger for religious beliefs than religious behavior. For college students and the general population, means of weighted and unweighted correlations between intelligence and the strength of religious beliefs ranged from −.20 to −.25 (mean r = −.24). Three possible interpretations were discussed. First, intelligent people are less likely to conform and, thus, are more likely to resist religious dogma. Second, intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic (as opposed to intuitive) thinking style, which has been shown to undermine religious beliefs. Third, several functions of religiosity, including compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence. Intelligent people may therefore have less need for religious beliefs and practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Miron"},{"family":"Silberman","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Judith A."}],"citation-key":"zuckermanRelationIntelligenceReligiosity2013","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/1088868313497266","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"325-354","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Relation Between Intelligence and Religiosity: A Meta-Analysis and Some Proposed Explanations","title-short":"The Relation Between Intelligence and Religiosity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868313497266","volume":"17"}
